With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.","Experts question if  packed out planes are putting passengers at risk .

The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV.

4,3da746a7d9afcaa659088c8366ef6347fe6b53ea,"Bruce Jenner will break his silence in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer later this month. The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November. Last September, she left the anchor chair of ABC World News and announced that she planned to focus on specials. In February, she presented 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', in which she went to prisons across the country to speak with female inmates.","Tell-all interview with the reality TV star, 69, will air on Friday April 24 .

A team from Dorset Fire and Rescue struggled to haul the huge black pig out of swimming pool water . The prize porker known as Pigwig had fallen into the water and had then been unable to get out again . Two fire crews and a specialist animal rescue team had to use slide boards and strops to haul the huge black pig from the small pool.

Wet and very bedraggled, the exhausted animal put up no opposition when firefighters arrived to hoist her out of the small garden pool in Heyshott. The two-hour rescue operation ended with the wayward horse being fitted with straps under her belly and lifted up into the air with an all-terrain crane before being swung around and deposited back on dry land.

6,6394f51b120ceb3da5e7b53dd5167fc4cf80b514,"The amount of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, the corporation’s boss has admitted. Figures show that while millions still tune in, they listen for much shorter bursts. The average listener spent just ten hours a week tuning in to BBC radio in the last three months of 2014, according to official figures. The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier, when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust’s February meeting, published yesterday, revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. ‘He noted…that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level,’ the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster-paced lives than in the past, and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall, BBC director general, highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust, according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow, as Apple develops its long-rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. ‘But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people ‘tune in’ in new, digital ways. ‘[Those ways] aren’t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here – like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.’ BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week, according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR, the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today’s standards, it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004, 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6, the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. ‘He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital-only station to reach two million listeners,’ the minutes said. Earlier this month, Matthew Postgate, the BBC’s chief technology officer, said the Corporation would adopt a new ‘digital first’ strategy, to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to ‘learn lessons’ if they want to ‘compete with organisations that were born in the digital age’.","Figures show that while millions still tune in they listen for shorter bursts .

8,57f68638739c3a1de8d9922b389d6ded39977012,"At 11:20pm, former world champion Ken Doherty potted a final black and extinguished, for now, the dream of Reanne Evans to become the first women player to play the hallowed baize of Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in the world snooker championship. In every other respect however, 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley, was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that won't be bettered in this year's qualifying tournament. Snooker's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport's blue-chip event on April 18 - something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10-8 victory at Ponds Forge . Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty . Doherty, who won the World Championship title back in 1997, took out the first frame 71-15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10-8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short-priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10-8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards: 'She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match, a different kind of pressure to what I've ever experienced. 'I don't usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I don't know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9-9, I'd have been a million-to-one to win it.' Evans, cheered on by her eight-year-old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield, admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10-time ladies' champion, Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5-4 in front . The 10-time ladies world champion collected just £400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013, and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. 'It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had, I just had to dig in,' she said. 'Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just couldn't take advantage in the end. 'I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can't return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women's game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. 'Next week, I will playing the ladies in the club again. It's a lovely club don't get me wrong but I don't think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I'd taken it to 9-9.' The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans' participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves didn't show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row, led 4-3 and once Doherty went in front, pegged him back to 5-5 and 6-6. The Irishman, now ranked No 46 in the world, started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right-handed or left-handed, as O'Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9-7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame – and he got it. Doherty, now ranked No 46 in the world, showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. 'They should let her play in more competitions,' he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women's sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall, where 10 snooker tables had been set up. Next time they will know exactly who she is, and what she can do.","Reanne Evans faced Ken Doherty in World Championship qualifier .

9,20778c35c19d741cc182719de336d71e1a0b228e,"A gang of six men have been jailed for a total of 31 years after being convicted of a string of sexual offences against teenager girls. The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people ""slags"" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. 'I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today. 'As a result young people will be safeguarded while these men will have time to reflect upon their actions in prison.' Convicted: Takudzwa Hova, 21, (left) was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, while Zsolt Szalontai, 18, (right) was sentenced to three years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institute after being found guilty of rape . Justice: The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence at Oxford Crown Court (pictured), who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag' Those jailed on Friday afternoon at Oxford Crown Court were: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, of Banbury, who was found guilty of 13 counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of assault by penetration. He was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years and nine months' imprisonment. Said Saleh, 20, from Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute. Takudzwa Hova, 21, of Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of rape. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Kagiso Manase, 26, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of sexual assault. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Manase had also pleaded guilty to possession of identity documents with intent. The offence related to being found in possession or control of a false South African passport and UK residence permit. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment to run consecutively.

Tunisian skipper Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, was arrested when he stepped onto Sicilian soil last night, some 24 hours after his  boat capsized in the Mediterranean. Before leaving the Italian coastguard vessel, however, he was forced to watch the bodies of 24 victims of the tragedy being carried off the ship for burial on the island of Malta. He was later charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and aiding illegal immigration. Prosecutors claim he contributed to the disaster by mistakenly ramming the overcrowded fishing boat into a merchant ship that had come to its rescue. As a result of the collision, the migrants shifted position on the boat, which was already off balance, causing it to overturn. Scroll down for videos .

Malek was also pictured with his alleged smuggler accomplice, a 26-year-old Syrian crew member named Mahmud Bikhit, who charged with 'aiding illegal immigration. Both men were to be put before a judge later today. Catania prosecutor Giovanni Salvi's office stressed that none of the crew aboard the Portuguese-flagged King Jacob is under investigation in the disaster. He said the crew members did their job in coming to the rescue of a ship in distress and that their activities 'in no way contributed to the deadly event.' Meanwhile, the survivors were brought to a migrant holding center in Catania and were 'very tired, very shocked, silent,' according to Flavio Di Giacomo of the International Organization for Migration. Most of the survivors and the victims appear to have been young men but there were also several children aged between 10 and 12, she added. 'We have not yet been able to ask them about this but it seems certain that many of them will have had friends and family who were lost in the wreck.' Deep in thought: Malek stares in space while waiting to leave the rescue vessel. Survivors told how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya . They told yesterday how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya. Some resorted to clinging to their floating corpses until Italian and Maltese coastguards came to rescue them in the dead of the night. The coast guard, meanwhile, reported that it saved some 638 migrants in six different rescue operations on Monday alone. On Tuesday, a further 446 people were rescued from a leaking migrant ship about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of the Calabrian coast. At talks in Luxembourg on Monday, EU ministers agreed on a 10-point plan to double the resources available to maritime border patrol mission Triton and further measures will be discussed at a summit of EU leaders on Thursday. Victims: Malek watches some of the bodies being taken off the rescue ship for burial in Malta . Grim: Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Relaxed: Malek grins on the desk of the Italian coastguard ship next to some of the migrant survivors . Critics say Triton is woefully inadequate and are demanding the restoration of a much bigger Italian operation suspended last year because of cost constraints. The survivors, who hailed from Mali, Gambia, Senegal, Somalia, Eritrea and Bangladesh, were all recovering Tuesday at holding centres near Catania on Sicily's eastern coast. Sunday's disaster was the worst in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1,700 lives this year - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 - and nearly 5,000 since the start of last year. In that time nearly 200,000 migrants have made it to Italy, mostly after being rescued at sea by the Italian navy and coastguard. Italian officials believe there could be up to one million more would-be immigrants to Europe waiting to board boats in conflict-torn Libya. Many of them are refugees from Syria's civil war or persecution in places like Eritrea. Others are seeking to escape poverty and hunger in Africa and south Asia and secure a better future in Europe. Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott urged the EU to introduce tough measures to stop migrants attempting to make the perilous sea voyage from North Africa to Europe. Mr Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said it was the only way to stop deaths. Hardline: Tony Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths . Haunted: Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . While Mr Abbott's controversial policy has proved successful, with the nation going nearly 18 months with virtually no asylum-seeker boat arrivals and no reported deaths at sea, human rights advocates say it violates Australia's international obligations. His comments came as EU foreign and interior ministers met in Luxembourg to discuss ways to stem the flood of people trying to reach Europe. Outlining his views on preventing the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, Mr Abbott told reporters: 'We have got hundreds, maybe thousands of people drowning in the attempts to get from Africa to Europe.' The 'only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats', he added. Yesterday, the Maltese Prime Minister declared a crisis, calling for EU countries to reinstate rescue operations. He warned: 'A time will come when Europe will be judged harshly for its inaction when it turned a blind eye to genocide. 'We have what is fast becoming a failed state on our doorsteps and criminal gangs are enjoying a heyday.' He estimated smugglers behind the doomed voyage from Libya to Europe would have made between €1million and €5million from selling desperate refugees spaces on the boat.","Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, has been charged with multiple manslaughter .

Last week South Korean prosecutors formally charged Kim Ki-Jong with attempted murder . The prosecutors' office in Seoul said Kim, was charged with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and obstruction of duty. Kim, 55, was a known maverick activist who had been handed a two-year suspended sentence in 2010 for hurling a rock at the then Japanese ambassador to Seoul. He has denied any intention to kill Lippert, but the prosecutors office said in a statement that the crime was clearly deliberate. 'There was an intention to murder because (Kim) used a lethal weapon in a pre-meditated crime to attack the ambassador's face and neck repeatedly,' it said. Kim has told investigators the ambassador was the 'symbolic' target of his opposition to annual US-South Korea joint military exercises, which he blames for blocking dialogue with North Korea. The annual drills have long been condemned by Pyongyang as rehearsals for invasion. Kim insisted he had acted alone and not on the orders of Pyongyang, but prosecutors said they were looking into whether he has violated the South's strict National Security Law banning any act seen as aiding North Korea or promoting its ideology. Investigators have ransacked Kim's home as part of an investigation into Kim's possible links with North Korea. Kim had visited the North seven times and once tried to erect a memorial in Seoul to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il after his death in 2011.

13,391b4610e3a9dcefd61e428155cc5afb2683124c,"(CNN)Warren Weinstein, who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it didn't have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert's release, either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein's capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate, even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped, the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban, which are both allied to al Qaeda, to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers, who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held, went door-to-door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a ""counterterrorism operation"" in January, which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America, which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan, CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal, North Waziristan, on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan, in which at least five militants were killed; and on January 4 in Datta Khel, South Waziristan, in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal, who was held by the Taliban until last year; Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman, a U.S. citizen, and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle; and Dr. Shakil Afridi, who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison, as well as Weinstein. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter, a California Republican, released a statement Thursday, saying, ""The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon -- led by war hero Jason Amerine."" As an Army captain, Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein's kidnapping from his house 3½  years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13, 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official, the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev, the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high-profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein's abduction. Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer -- who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26, 2011. At the scene of Taseer's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore, according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, a semi-autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein's freedom. On September 12, 2012, Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown ""no interest in my case."" He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from ""one Jew to another"" to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy, which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First, families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones, which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council, to oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command, which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and ""de-conflict"" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third, while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups, there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens, and this should be encouraged, even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria, including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis, and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, it's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. In captivity, Coleman, who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage, had a child. The name of the child is unknown.","U.S. hostage Warren Weinstein is believed to have been accidentally killed in counter-terrorism strike .

Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices.

Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performing companies by The 2015 Australian Fashion Report. Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara. The report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in Australia. The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country's legally set minimum wage, a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food, water, electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month and a living wage is US$104, the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performers . 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid, said . 'A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum, and even then, only for part of their supply chain,' the report states. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. 'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected.' Uzbekistan for instance, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its  child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently  improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis'. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs,' the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said. 'There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. 'The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they're doing to protect workers and on top of that that they haven't engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage, but one quarter didn't.' However the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like Kmart and Cotton On improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers, and H&M, Zara, Country Road and the Sussan Group showing attempts to improve their international worker's pay.","Australian Fashion Report revealed the Australian-sold brands and companies that ignore the exploitation of their overseas workers .

A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna ‘Nick’ Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a ‘nasty crunch’ as the 34-year-old’s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was ‘a few cheap packets of cigarettes’. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: ‘Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. ‘With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. ‘Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.’ A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna’s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O’Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr Prasanna . ‘He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes,’ he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: ‘Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. ‘I can’t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? “ . ‘You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.’ McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O’Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men - cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll and Michael McInerney - tried to grab cigarettes from Mr Prasanna's van before speeding off in separate vehicles. All have now been jailed . In two vans they went to three sites, where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon, before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary’s Hospital in London, 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager. Mr Prasanna later opened his own shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with his younger brother Uday. They opened another store in Sittingbourne, Kent, and were looking at starting a third Southampton.

18,a02e362c5b8f049848ce718b37b96117485461cf,"(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.","Smoke from massive fires in Siberia created fiery sunsets in the Pacific Northwest .

They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683. In a country where cows dominate the rural landscape, the discovery in an Austrian cellar shocked scientists. The researchers described it as a 'sunken ship in the desert'. Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of an 'alien' 17th-century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman-Habsburg war. They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683 . Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian-dromedary hybrid – a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time. 'The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle,' said Alfred Galik, a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. 'But one look at the cervical vertebrae, the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel.' The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated.

Galik and his team also said the cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The remarkable find was made during an archaeological dig that took place amid preparations for a new shopping centre in the town. If modern-day scientists were stumped by the find, it would have been an even greater shock for residents of 17th-century Tulln. 'The animal was certainly exotic for the people of Tulln. They probably didn't know what to feed it or whether one could eat it,' Galik said. While Roman-era camel bones occasionally surface in Austria, Serbia and Belgium, the Tulln discovery was the first complete camel skeleton to emerge in Central Europe.

20,75fdaee82f6d0545a86b9d28b947186ce4b2a088,"(CNN)Would you want a TV program about your family history to include details of a distant, long-deceased relative who had owned slaves? Seriously, who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline? I wouldn't, and neither did Ben Affleck, who lobbied producers of a PBS show, ""Finding Your Roots,"" to remove any reference to his great-great-great grandfather Benjamin Cole, a Georgia slave owner in the mid-1800's, in an episode that looked at Affleck's family history. (Affleck revealed Cole's name Wednesday night.) Here's the thing that might surprise many, given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material: The show's producer, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., apparently acquiesced to Affleck's request, because when the episode aired in October 2014, there was no mention of the star's slave-owning ancestor. Affleck's attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after WikiLeaks released hacked emails revealing an exchange between Gates and Sony Pictures chief Michael Lynton. When Gates asked how he should respond to Affleck's request to delete the material, Lynton responded, ""all things being equal, I would definitely take it out."" And on Tuesday, Affleck, via Facebook, admitted that he had urged Gates to excise any reference to his slave-owning relative. Affleck explained, ""I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth."" Now Gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on Affleck's request, but it seems likely that he did. After all, Affleck noted as much in his Facebook post, writing that Gates ""agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with."" And three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners. So it's unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to Affleck's familial slave ownership connection. In any event, PBS has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards. Whatever the results of the review, Affleck and Gates did the right thing. Let's be clear: ""Finding Your Roots"" is not an investigative news show; it's an entertainment program. In fact, as Affleck noted, much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled. It's not ""60 Minutes"" but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities, using their marquee names to attract viewers. There's not even a hint that Affleck strong-armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information. In the emails between Gates and Lynton, which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so, there was no mention of undue pressure by Affleck. Instead, Gates simply noted that Affleck  ""asked us to edit out something."" After the emails were revealed, Gates issued a statement, saying, ""Ultimately, I maintain editorial control on all of my projects and, with my producers, decide what will make for the most compelling program. In the case of Mr. Affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry -- including a Revolutionary War ancestor, a third great-grandfather who was an occult enthusiast, and his mother who marched for civil rights during the Freedom Summer of 1964."" My view would be different if Affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct. That would have made the information truly newsworthy. But instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes, which I'm sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future. Perhaps that's what Affleck meant in his Facebook post when he wrote that this information made him feel ""vulnerable."" Affleck has noted that he regrets asking PBS to not include information about his ""distant relative.""  That's a nice gesture, but it was not needed. Affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long-deceased distant relative to be left out of the show. And PBS had the choice to include it or leave it out. I applaud PBS for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye.","Ben Affleck admits he asked PBS show ""Finding Your Roots"" to avoid mentioning his slave-owning ancestor .

21,42482902d939b1d1e1182a58a5b313fde9b8484f,"Wanted: A police e-fit image of millionaire people trafficker Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made £72m with his accomplice Mered Medhanie from smuggling migrants in the last two years . Two millionaire people traffickers have been heard mocking the migrant boat disasters that have resulted in thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean, it has been reported. One of them, an Eritrean called Mered Medhanie, also known as The General, was heard laughing on a police wiretap about overloading migrant ships, a problem that causes them to capsize. Medhanie, 34, who is based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is said to have boasted: 'They say I put too many aboard, but they're the ones who want to leave in a hurry.' A second trafficker, Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made £72million with Medhanie from smuggling in the last two years, also showed callous disregard for the plight of his 'customers'. He was heard declaring last summer: 'They organised another trip a few days ago. I don't know what happened – they probably died.' Ghermay, who also lives in Tripoli, was already wanted on an arrest warrant in connection with an October 2013 capsizing off Lampedusa that left 366 dead. Reports of the conversations come just days after at least 900 people were feared to have drowned in one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. More than 1,700 have perished in the last week alone. Italian police yesterday released Ghermay's photofit as they sought to track down the pair, who are among several traffickers wanted in connection with a major human smuggling ring. Ghermay and Medhanie are currently living undisturbed in Tripoli, exploiting the lawlessness in the collapse state which has allowed smugglers to operate with impunity since the fall of Gaddafi. Medhanie, who reportedly compares himself to the former Libyan dictator, and his accomplice enjoy the protection of local law authorities in the capital after it was taken over by a rival Islamist faction. A Italian naval officer stands in front of rescued migrants on board the Italian Navy vessel Bettica as they arrive in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta after being the latest group to be rescued from the Mediterranean . Terrified: Boys embrace as they arrive with migrants at the Sicilian harbor of Augusta with the Italian navy . In another wire tap recording, Medhanie, who is thought to have a wife and child in Sweden, is heard expressing scant regard for migrant suffering. 'We do an illegal job – but what do you expect? We're not the government,' he says, according to La Stampa as reported by The Independent. Others reveal how his business is booming, with him heard to say: 'This year I've done well – I sent off 7,000 to 8,000.' Another intercept reveals a discussion between Medhanie and his accomplices in Italy about the possibility of setting up bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates, but opting for U.S. or Canadian banks because 'they don't ask you where the money comes from.' Safe: European governments came under increasing pressure to tackle the Mediterranean's migrant crisis ahead of a summit as harrowing details emerged of the fate of hundreds who died over the weekend . Rescued migrants wait to disembark from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica  in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . Barbaric human traffickers are separating migrants by race, locking those with the darkest skin below deck where death is inevitable if the boat sinks, survivors have told. Teenagers arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa told how passengers from sub-Saharan Africa were placed in the hold with no water, sunlight or, crucially, means of escape. One boy from Somalia told aid workers from Save The Children: 'The Libyans who got me to Italy are not human. 'They pushed eight Nigerians into the sea. They all drowned.' Conversely, Yusuf, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who fled Gaza for Italy in February, said he was placed on an upper level with other people from the Middle East, it was reported by The Independent. Police in Palermo arrested 15 people on Monday in connection with a smuggling ring they say was masterminded by Ghermay. Prosecutors say the network had generated transactions worth hundreds of thousands of euros criss-crossing Europe as migrants paid not only to cross the Mediterranean but also to join relatives in northern Europe. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia said based on telephone intercepts, the average cost to smuggle a migrant from Eritrea or Ethiopia to Libya ran $4,000 to $5,000, while the crossing to Italy cost an additional $1,000 to $1,500. Migrants pay hundreds of dollars more to get out of holding centers and at least another $1,000 to travel to northern Europe. Payments for each leg are made up front, often using the Islamic hawala banking system which is based on an informal honour code in which a relative in northern Europe pays a local broker. The payment information is then transmitted to the actual traffickers on the ground advising them that the leg has been paid for. European governments were today under mounting pressure to act decisively on the Mediterranean migrant crisis as harrowing details emerged of the fate of those who died in the worst tragedy to date. With the crisis set to be discussed at an emergency summit on Thursday, allegations of callous disregard for Arab and African lives are pushing EU leaders to respond to a disaster in which 800 people are feared to have died in appalling circumstances off the coast of Libya on Sunday.

A police handout showing Mohammed Ali Malek (left) and Mahmud Bikhit (right) after their arrest in Malta . The vast majority of those on board were locked in the hold or the middle deck of the 20-metre (66-foot) boat when it capsized following a collision with a Portuguese cargo ship responding to its distress signal. Only 28, including two crew members who have been arrested, survived and 24 bodies have been recovered. Survivors have described the moment the doomed ship sank, telling how how they clung to dead bodies in the pitch black sea in order to stay afloat. They also accused the captain of being drunk moments before he rammed another ship, causing the tragedy. Bangladeshi Riajul Islam, 17, said the only reason he survived was because he was on the top deck and knew how to swim. Nasir Khan, a fellow 17-year-old Bangladeshi, said he was also on the top deck and lived by clinging on to a life vest. The stricken boat initially set off from Egypt and then stopped off on the Libyan coast near the city Zuwarah to pick up more passengers, it has been reported. It set off from Libya on Saturday and sent out a distress signal shortly before midnight 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa. It later capsized.","Mered Medhanie and Ermias Ghermay 'have made £72m in last two years'

But yesterday the underemployed 26-year-old was spotted enjoying the high life in an overseas location yet again, this time at the Bahrain Grand Prix . She was in the Gulf state, ruled by a controversial king whose regime has been accused of violently repressing pro-democracy activists, with her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark, according to an onlooker who saw her among dignitaries on the starting grid before the race. ‘She was walking behind the Crown Prince of Bahrain. She was introduced to the recently abdicated King Carlos of Spain and curtseyed,’ the source said. ‘Bernie Ecclestone was leading that group of dignitaries. I think she watched the race from the tower high above the circuit with the Crown Prince.’ It is thought legendary Formula 1 racing driver Sir Jackie Stewart and comedian Rory Bremner were also among those in the tower enjoying the spectacular view as Britain’s Lewis Hamilton won after battling it out over the 57 laps of the 192 mile race with arch rivals Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg.

23,8cbab1e00c52ae5b6405e221fc0eefeae00e3454,"After nearly two years of jockeying with Congress over the IRS's history of discriminating against conservative nonprofit groups, former official Lois Lerner won't be charged with a crime for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions. U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, on his last day in office, told House Speaker John Boehner in a seven-page letter that Lerner could wrap herself in the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, even though she offered a self-serving opening statement before clamming up during a May 22, 2013 hearing. Lerner has long been in the GOP's crosshairs because she led the IRS department tasked with approving nonprofit groups' applications for tax-exempt status. Beginning in 2010, the department gave conservative groups with words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names extra scrutiny, slow-walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had subpoenaed Lerner after she refused to testify voluntarily about her role in the scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE DOJ'S LETTER TO BOEHNER . I'LL TELL THE TRUTH ... UNLESS I'M TAKING THE FIFTH: Former IRS official Lois Lerner insisted on her innocence in an opening statement during a 2013 congressional hearing, and then refused to answer lawmakers' questions – a choice that the Obama administration now says was perfectly legal . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen (left) dropped his bomb on Congress just one day before leaving office to return to private legal practice . Emailed? Machen's letter was addressed to House Speaker John Boehner (left), who was in Jerusalem visiting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) When she refused again to answer questions during a second hearing on March 5, 2014, House Republicans prepared a criminal contempt citation and referred the case to the Justice Department once it was approved. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, then the Oversight committee's chairman, told Lerner in one hearing that she had 'effectively waived your rights' by defending herself under oath. 'I have not done anything wrong,' Lerner had said in the 2013 hearing. 'I have not broken any laws, I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.' Machen told Boehner on Tuesday that since Lerner had only made 'general claims of innocence,' she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions. 'Ms. Lemer's general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to ""testimony"" about the actual facts under the Committee's review,' he said. 'The Fiflh Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense, should she be prosecuted ,,, for her refusal to testify.' Machen's March 31 letter arrived on Capitol Hill just a day before his resignation took effect after a five-year stint as Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor inside the Justice Department. President Barack Obama named him to his post in December 2009. Reactions swept through the nation's capital as word spread that Lerner was, legally, in the clear. 'Once again, the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online. 'But unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the First Amendment strikes at the heart of our democracy, and the American people deserve the truth.' 'The White House,' said Steel, 'still has the opportunity to do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS’ actions.' Attorney General Eric Holder has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel, instead appointing attorney Barbara Bosserman to lead an internal probe. Republicans see Bosserman as a politically conflicted choice: Federal Election Commission records show that she donated a total of $6,750 to  Obama’s campaigns and to the Democratic National Committee. SWITCH: During the tea party targeting hearings, it was Oversight committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (left) who was regularly exasperated – but now Darrell Issa (right), his Republican foil at the time is frustrated by a lack of accountability for Lerner . Tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the IRS often green-lighted liberal groups in weeks or months . Issa, whose outrage led to the congressional contempt citation against Lerner – and one against Holder, for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal – was livid. 'Refusing to prosecute Mrs. Lerner and Mr. Holder after they were held in contempt by a vote of the House of Representatives sends a disturbing message that it is permissible for senior government officials to lie to Congress and to ignore subpoenas for information vital to Congressional investigations,' he said Wednesday in a statement. Issa's successor as chairman of the Oversight committee, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, said Machen's letter 'exhibits a disregard for the rule of law' and scoffed at his objectivity. 'It is unclear whether the Administration directed Mr. Machen not to prosecute Lois Lerner, or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with IRS’s leadership,' Chaffetz said. 'The Committee will continue to pursue its ongoing investigation into the targeting of American citizens based on their political beliefs. Our goal is to ensure that the people responsible, including Lois Lerner, are held accountable.' Lerner's attorney, William Taylor, said in a statement that his client 'looks forward to moving on with her life.' 'It is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen's constitutional rights,' Taylor said.

The comments, which Brett McGurk made in an exclusive interview, were some of the administration's strongest to date in describing the challenge the United States and its allies face in battling ISIS. ""This is a problem that is off the charts historically,"" he said, referring to the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have gone into Syria. ""Just put that into perspective: It's about twice the number that went into Afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10-year period to fight the Soviet Union, and those came really from only a handful of countries."" He concluded, ""We're in unchartered territory here."" McGurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in Jordan. Last week, Canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria. The United States now lists 62 countries in the coalition. As the U.S.-led coalition has focused attention on Iraq and Syria, ISIS has expanded its reach to Libya, Egypt and Yemen, often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants. McGurk did not rule out expanding U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria to combat the increasing regional threat. ""We have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests, some of which are military tools,"" he said. ""Of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do."" The United States has also been stepping up efforts to involve Sunni groups in the fight against ISIS. To date, that involvement has been extremely limited as Sunni tribes see Shiite militias, many with horrendous human rights records, take the lead. But McGurk said that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is making progress getting Sunni tribes to support a planned Iraqi offensive against ISIS in Anbar province in the coming weeks. He stressed the importance of working with al-Abadi, noting that the Iraqi leader was in Anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 AK-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the Iraqi security forces. ""We are helping to enable and train (them) as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in Anbar,"" McGurk said. ""They put out this very perverse, twisted vision, and it's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world,"" he acknowledged. ""But in fact, what the foreign fighters are finding in Syria and Iraq is that they're more likely to get killed in Iraq and Syria, and in fact, instead of getting a slave bride as ISIS leaders promise them, they're more likely to get killed by a female Peshmerga fighter in the streets of Kobani."" That bottom line, he assessed, could turn the tide: ""The foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate, and I think we're going to see those networks begin to dry up.""","Obama's point man in ISIS fight doesn't rule out U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria .

He’s also lost a lot of weight, he’s going out jogging.’ Asked if he thought Mr Cameron was too vain, Mr Farage said: ‘To a certain extent they all are. Some people it worries to death and others really don’t worry too much.’ Mr Cameron, 48, has previously been accused of visiting stylists and even trichologists to keep his hair looking youthful. In 2011, Downing Street was forced to deny claims Mr Cameron was fighting the relentless process with unnatural help after his grey hairs looked less prominent, . ‘I promise you he has not dyed his hair,’ a spokesman said. ‘The Prime Minister has other things to think about, he’s just not like that.’ Mr Farage said he was ‘jealous’ of how the Tory leader has reversed the greying process while in Downing Street .

She wants to do it by herself and most of these kids want to do that too,' he told WBRC. 'It's logical for people who are explosives investigators. It's just a battery, beeper and a switch... pretty simple.' Giggling and running around the play area at Brimingham's regional center, the blind children filled baskets with the beeping eggs, before trading them in for candy.

Jamyra Gallmon, 21, has been charged with first-degree murder while armed for allegedly killing David Messerschmitt, 30, on February 9 in Washington, D.C. The woman admitted to police that she set up the lawyer using a masculine-sounding email address and went to the upscale Donovan hotel with the intention of robbing him. Scroll down for video . Jamyra Gallmon, 21, (pictured graduating from her military academy high school) has been charged with first-degree felony murder while armed for allegedly stabbing to death 30-year-old David Messerschmitt on February 9 . David Messerschmitt (pictured with his wife Kim) was found dead in his DC hotel room in February. An affidavit revealed on Thursday that he had been soliciting sex from men through Craigslist . According to Gallmon, who was seen on surveillance camera entering the hotel wearing androgynous clothing including black boots, black pants and a black hooded jacket, the room door was open when she arrived. The affidavit stated that the pair got into a struggle and the defendant pulled a knife from her pants and stabbed the victim repeatedly until he fell to the floor where she stabbed him several more times. The victim was found with multiple stab wounds to the back, groin and abdomen along with one wound which pierced his heart and another which hit his spinal cord. His hands had been bound with zip-ties into a pair of makeshift cuffs. His hands were covered in defensive wounds. Messerschmitt had texted his wife Kim Vuong at 7.45pm on February 9 to tell her he would be home in an hour after leaving his law office. He never returned and the next day he was found dead at his hotel room with 'various credit cards strewn about'. He death was declared a homicide. Among the  items recovered from the room were a computer, lubricant, condoms, cell phone and enema kit, Fox DC reported. Fingerprints were also found in the room. Investigators discovered that Messerschmitt had posted a Craigslist ad on February 9, soliciting responses from other men, using 'dcguy456'. The lawyer began an exchange with an individual, using the name 'chrissanchez0906', around 2pm which continued throughout the day. Messerschmitt told the individual his room number at the hotel and gave a meeting time of 7pm - 7.30pm. The email address that the lawyer had been in contact with was linked to Gallmon. On a search of the woman's DC apartment, police found a knife, black boots and gloves, and a pack of zip ties. A discussion in the comments section of a Queerty.com article about Mr Messerschmitt's murder in February included users referencing interactions with an individual using the handle 'dcguy456'. One commenter said that 'dcguy456' had previously posted on the 'M4M' (men for men) section of Craigslist and identified himself as bisexual. Another individual's post claimed that he had exchanged emails with 'dcguy456'and met up with him several years ago. A woman has been arrested in connection to the murder of 30-year-old Washington, DC lawyer David Messerschmitt. Above, the 'person of interest' who was caught on surveillance video entering the hotel where Messerschmitt was killed on February 9. Police confirmed that this was Gallmon . Jamyra Gallmon attended Forestville Military Academy in Maryland and was an exemplary student, a teacher said on Thursday. According to an affidavit, it is believed that Mr Messerschmitt got her to come to his hotel room believing that he was soliciting a man . Gallmon made an initial appearance on the felony murder charge Superior Court in DC on Thursday. The 21-year-old attended the Forestville Military Academy in Maryland, a coach toldFox 5 on Thursday and had been an exemplary student. She graduated in 2011. Her mother told NBC that her daughter had never been in trouble before and had an ambition to join the military. Coach and teacher, Vincent McDuffie, told the station that she had wanted to play basketball in college but had suffered a knee injury. He said that her supportive family always turned up to watch her high school games. According to the police report, Messerchmitt left his work at law film, DLA Piper, around 5.30pm on February 9 and texted his wife a couple of hours later to say he would back at their Capitol Hill home in an hour. The couple reportedly had not seen each other since February 8, but Vuong didn't think anything seemed wrong with her husband. She reported him missing at midnight, saying it was unlike him to disappear and that usually he got home before her. Messerschmitt was found dead in his room the next day and pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities  have arrested a Washington, DC woman named Jamyra Gallmon for the crime.

28,a8eb7e7d14517a32761b8609a6f4b0b1c7de9597,"Notorious mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe, who has spent three decades in jail, is to be moved to a cushy low security unit, it has been claimed . The families of victims of Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe are furious at plans to move him from Broadmoor to a low-security Priory unit. Mass murderer Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor for the savage killings of 13 women. But now, despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers, Sutcliffe may be moved to a cushy Priory unit set in Berkshire woodland. Sutcliffe is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse and said he no longer hears the 'voices from God' which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial. A report is being compiled which will be heard next month at a prison tribunal which will rule if the move goes ahead. But families of his victims are furious about the move. Neil Jackson, whose mother Emily, 46, became the Ripper's second victim in 1976, told the Sun: 'He should not be moved at all. 'As he's in Broadmoor, he should stay there and they should throw away the key. This just rubs salt into the wounds of families and I believe any remorse he has shown is fake.' A source at the prison told the newspaper Sutcliffe was optimistic about the move - despite being previously turned down for a transfer to the unit which boasts facilities such as a fully-fitted gym and music room. Plans of his referral follow allegations earlier this year that Sutcliffe, who used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England, was enjoying an easy lifestyle in jail. Scroll down for video . Potential plans to move Britain's most notorious mass murderer from the high security Broadmoor prison hospital to the Priory . Hospital: Broadmoor's corridors look ordinary, but it houses some of Britain's most disturbed individuals . He was said to be eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, as well as being privileged to receive visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours. It was claimed he is also given money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah’s Witness and was even given a baptism. In the evenings, he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the Sun on Sunday reported. A new image of a relaxed-looking Sutcliffe – the first for 20 years – supports the cushy lifestyle claim. There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard. He had ballooned with some reports estimating his weight at 19 or 20 stone, which is said to be down to a love of chocolate and burgers, and now sufferers from type 2 diabetes. Sutcliffe is currently said to enjoy a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, it was claimed . The Priory Thornford Park set in Berkshire woodland . While officials refused to comment on the move, it is thought that Sutcliffe would be transferred to a unit such as the Priory Thornford Park. Based just 30 miles from Broadmoor, it is set in Berkshire woodland and offers a fully equipped gym and running track, a music room and occupational therapy suite. A 'rehab kitchen' and computer  and education rooms are also amongst the high-end facilities at the unit. The red-brick building houses 122 men with mental illness, compared to Broadmoor's 210, with a combination of low and medium secure beds. Past residents include dangerous criminal John Maguir, convicted for assault, who escaped by scaling a wall and child sex abuser Peter Pickering. Its website states its users are 'among the most vulnerable members of society and require sensitive therapeutic interventions delivered in a healing environment that encourages self-awareness, knowledge and empowerment.' The full list of facilities include: . The former trucker, who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five-year killing spree, has seen his health deteriorate in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and was reported to have suffered a heart attack. The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was also told  he could lose what remains of his sight within a year due to an eye condition. He had refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately. The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims’ families. Roofer Neil Jackson, 56, whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe’s second victim, said: ‘He tore apart our family and this just looks like he’s being rewarded. He’s getting an easy life and he’s clearly enjoying every minute. I hope the lifestyle kills him. ‘It doesn’t matter how many years go by, it doesn’t make the pain of what he did any easier.’ Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, after an attack by another prisoner in 1982 with a broken coffee jar . Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor since he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree. The killer, who believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill sex workers, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly. He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left . It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. The Priory and the Prison Service declined to comment on the move while a spokeswoman for the Department of Health, which is responsible for the medical unit, said they would not comment on individual cases.","Serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, 68, was jailed for life for murdering 13 women .

29,76e0aa30e7033a161a11ce7c4692822772f63ade,"English essential: This laminated document announces the new ISIS nursing school and lists the language entry requirements for would-be nurses . Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in Syria have announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates. Details of the first nursing school to be opened in ISIS-held territory were revealed by on Twitter by Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently - an activist group based in the Syrian city that uses a network of brave informers to document the daily atrocities carried out by the Islamic extremists. RIBSS shared a photograph of a laminated document written in Arabic  giving details of the new medical school and listing the entry requirements for would-be nurses. It states that all candidates be aged between 18 and 25, pass an entry exam, impress during an interview, graduated from secondary school with science qualifications, be willing to travel to any ISIS-held area, and willing work for ISIS institutions for at least two years after graduating. The document also states the importance of English - saying candidates will not be accepted without knowing how to speak and understand the language. This is in stark contrast with Britain where English language checks for all nurses are still not being enforced, despite legislation being passed last month making them a legal requirement. Jihadis: ISIS has English language rules for all nurses. The NHS does not have the same level of checks . Although the law has changed, the Nursing and Midwifery Council must engage in a lengthy consultation process, draft new legislation and seek council approval before it can test the English language skills of nurses who trained within the EU. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating. However the announcement in Raqqa promised that graduate nurses who achieved top grades and showed the most promise at the school will be considered for places as ISIS' medical school, where they can train for better paid jobs such as doctors and surgeons. ISIS' English language rules have been put in place long before the NHS has been able to bring in similar checks. Militants: Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating . ISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'. The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. Last year the law was changed to make it legal for all foreign nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the European Union to be forced to take an IELTS language exam if it was felt their English made them unsafe in a medical environment. Since then 429 doctors from outside the EU have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. Similar rules were passed last month extending those rules to prospective medical who trained inside the EU, a rule quickly adopted by doctors and dentists. The rule is still not being by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, however, as the regulator requires a lengthy public consultation process before it can amend its rules. Even then the law will only apply to candidates who medical authorities judge could be a danger due to poor English language skills. In such an instance the nurse would first be required to prove sufficient English language experience - such as from a GCSE-style qualification - or they will be forced to take the British Council's IELTS qualification, to access whether they have reached a suitable level for their job.","ISIS has announced that all nurses working for them must speak English .

30,7f53ab255bad30f06dccb9041db53f4b8f5ad29c,"Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters on Wednesday, as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par-three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par, only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par-3 Contest on a play-off against Camilo Villegas . Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the 'curse' of the par-three champion, with no player ever becoming par-three and Masters champion in the same year. However, that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11-year-old caddie Ethan Couch, who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make-a-Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light-hearted curtain-raiser. Augusta National's par-three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major . 'It was a really fun day, especially to have Ethan with me here,' Streelman said. 'This isn't about me today. It's about helping him out and showing him a great day.' Villegas said: 'I've made a few hole-in-ones, but it's pretty special to make them here. The second one, we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped.' Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth, his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par-three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years . That took the 75-year-old six-time champion to three under par, but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole-in-one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. 'Send me a bill,' Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan . The 18-time major winner added on ESPN: 'I never had a hole in one at Augusta, in the par three (contest) or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there, make a hole-in-one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked.' Since the contest started in 1960, nobody has ever become par-three and Masters champion in the same week, a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies, including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus (centre) with Ben Crenshaw (left) and Gary Player (right) during the Par-3 Contest . 'We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime,' said Woods, who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter: 'I'll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day.' Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. 'I apologise to golf,' Horan joked. 'I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure.' McIlroy, who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday, added: 'I wanted to do this because it's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood. To spend a couple of hours like this was fun.'","Kevin Streelman beat Camilo Villegas on third play-off hole at Augusta .

But that did not stop the Palestinian youngster, dressed in full combat gear, from attempting to pelt Israeli police with stones during violent clashes on the West Bank. The bemused officers, equipped with helmets and body armour, calmly watched as the child launched his own assault before racing away. The incident raised fears that Palestinian children are being encouraged to mimic and glorify violence. David and Goliath battle: A five-year-old Palestinian boy pelted the Israeli police with stones as violence erupted during a rally in the northern West Bank . The dark-haired child, dressed in combat gear, raced back to safety after launching a series of missiles at around six heavily armed officers . The boy's stone attack came as violence erupted  on the northern West Bank during annual demonstrations to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day. Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd after more than 100 Palestinians rallied near Israel's separation barrier in the village of Bilin, with some throwing stones. At least one protester was believed to have been injured as violence flared on the streets. Prisoners Day is marked every year in solidarity with the more than 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. 'We will not leave our prisoners in jail alone,' rally organiser Abdullah Abu Rahma said. 'We will defend their right to be released, because the majority of them have been arrested illegally by Israeli forces.' With Israel having arrested some 800,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories since 1967 - equivalent to 40 percent of the male population - almost every Palestinian family has been affected. During the last round of US-backed peace talks in 2013 and 2014, Israel freed dozens of long-term inmates. But after the negotiations broke down, and following the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, Israel arrested hundreds more. The current number of Palestinian prisoners is the highest for at least five years, according to figures from rights groups.

'I have just said to the players that I feel very proud of them considering we only had two days to work,' said former Latics skipper Caldwell. 'It's crazy, absolutely crazy. An all-consuming job. But I loved every minute of it and can't wait for the next one. I've had a lot of managers texting me saying 'welcome to the madhouse' and I can see what they mean.' A point lifted Wigan above Millwall, who they face on Tuesday, on goal difference but both teams are seven points adrift of safety. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle, but he still insists there is plenty to play for. 'We'll try to win every game,' he added. 'There's 12 points to play for and we'll try to win every one and see what happens. 'It's going to be a long process to get the club to where we want it to be. But tonight was the way we want to play, that's how this club got success.' Fulham should now be safe, having edged nine points clear of the drop zone, but they were booed off by sections of the home support. Boss Kit Symons' honeymoon period seems to be over, as his decision to take off goalscorer Smith after an hour was met with a chorus of 'you don't know what you're doing'. Fulham captain Scott Parker (right) is hassled for the ball by Wigan's Gaetan Bong (left) at Craven Cottage . The ever industrious Parker (left) dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan's Kim Bo-Kyung (right) 'Matt was shattered,' he explained. 'He's had a lot of football recently and we needed some fresh legs.' Symons has the air of a manager who cannot wait for the season to come to an end. 'It's glass half full, glass half empty,' he added. 'We're a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. 'It's been a tough season, to put it mildly, and realistically it was probably always going to be like that. When we stay up I certainly won't be doing cartwheels, but I'll breathe a sigh of relief.'","Fulham 2-2 Wigan Athletic: CLICK HERE to read the match report .

Jet Set Candy, which offers a collection of destination-specific charms aimed at helping people to choose where they should head on their travels, enables you to take your pick of Britain’s Royals with the Marry British Royalty Spinner Charm, giving users eight possibilities for a 'future husband' - including 'King-to-be George'. 'Fancy your chances with Prince Harry? Got eyes for a Duke? Tie the knot with a British Royal and go from commoner to Queen. Your palace awaits!' reads the description of the fanciful charm, which comes in 14K gold vermeil or sterling silver for $198 and $148, respectively. Here's hoping: Jewelry brand Jet Set Candy's Marry British Royalty Spinner Charm comes in 14K gold vermeil (L) and sterling silver (R) and retails for $198 and $148, respectively . Eligible bachelor: Prince Harry is one of the eight 'future husbands' listed on the charm's playful spinner wheel . The charm has a double-sided Wheel of Fortune-style spinner, allowing wearers to predict their fate with one quick spin. While the front lists one-year-old Prince George and 30-year-old Prince Harry, as well as other more generic options such as ‘Duke’, ‘Marquess’, ‘Earl’, ‘Viscount’, ‘Baron’ and ‘Commoner’, as the options for your future husband, the flip side offers eight 'future homes', allocating you anything from a palace, castle or estate to an abbey, manor, house, cottage – or even foreclosure. Meanwhile, the charm silently acknowledges that 32-year-old Prince William, who is awaiting the birth of his second child with Kate, is already taken - by not mentioning him at all. The jewelry brand, which is perfect for anyone who has the travel bug, also sells similar spinner charms for other cities, as well as various destination pendants, luggage tag charms, link bracelets, engraved bangles and more.

Then came the admission that while Aidan, 31, very 'definitely' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares, he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes. Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer, @AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven? The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 . While others have commented that even a smattering is too much. User Laura Kate said: 'I just can't forgive that chest hair. I just can't! But it's Aiden turner I could try. #Poldark'. And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.'","Photos taken for BBC show Being Human see Aidan Turner with a full 'rug'

In a shock new poll that will send shockwaves through Downing Street, the Labour leader has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. The Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories with just 28 days until polling day, according to the pollsters Survation. Labour leader Ed Miliband has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings, a Survation poll has revealed . The revelation comes in the wake of a furious political row over the Labour leader’s personal character – after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband could stab Britain in the back like he did to his brother. Mr Miliband responded by accusing the Tories of dragging the election campaign ‘into the gutter’. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader. But the campaign could backfire if Mr Miliband overtakes the Prime Minister in the polls. According to tonight’s Survation poll for the Daily Mirror, with less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. Labour is up 2 points on 35, the Conservatives down one to 31. Nigel Farage’s Ukip, meanwhile, are down three to 15 with the Lib Dems still struggling on just 9 per cent. The SNP and the Greens are on 4 per cent each. It is the biggest Labour lead in a Survation poll since February and was conducted after the party announced plans to scrap a ‘tax loophole’ used by wealthy ‘non doms’ to lower their tax bills. With less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader . According to tonight’s poll, nearly seven out of ten voters back Mr Miliband’s proposal to scrap the non dom tax status. Four out of 10 voters ‘strongly’ support the move – with just 14 per cent opposed. The poll surveyed 1,111 people on Wednesday and Thursday. Miliband announced on Wednesday that he wanted to scrap tax rules that allow wealthy individuals to legally reduce the amount of tax they pay on money earned overseas. The Survation poll found 59 percent of respondents supported the idea. A separate poll, by Yougov for The Sun newspaper on Wednesday, gave Labour a one percentage point lead over the Conservatives.","Miliband overtakes David Cameron as the most popular political leader .

Corden was all smiles as he posed in between the duo. James Corden (centre) posted a picture alongside Odell Beckham Jnr (left) and David Beckham via Twitter . Both Beckhams, who are of no relation, were pictured in America with the 36-year-old - who is currently filming late-night talk show Late Late in the States. Last month David Beckham lifted the lid on his son Brooklyn's first date, in which the former Manchester United midfielder watched on from a nearby table in a London restaurant. Speaking as a guest on Corden's show, the ex-Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star told the hilarious story of his 16-year-old son's first foray into the world of dating. When probed by Corden, who asked, 'He must be getting quite big into the dating circuit now?', Beckham replied: ''Yeah, it's happening. He's going to hate me for this. 'I'm fine with it, because on his first date - when he was about 14 and a half - it was Valentine's Day so he said, ""I'd love to take this girl to dinner.""

Commuters were urged to avoid travelling through Holborn if possible, and firefighters were unable to estimate when the situation might return to normal. Tonight 35 firefighters and police officers remain at Kingsway, where flames were seen erupting from a manhole cover yesterday. Kingsway is closed, as is the Strand underpass, while Waterloo Bridge is closed northbound. Transport for London said that 15 bus routes were being diverted, and witnesses described seeing dozens of buses backed up along High Holborn, but Underground services have returned to normal. More than 1,000 buildings remain without power today, with businesses, government departments and tourist attractions forced to close ahead of the Easter weekend. firefighters and gas workers continue to tackle the flames in the Kingsway Service Tunnel . Carnage: Parts of the road had to be dug up in an attempt to extinguish the fire below the ground . The underground fire has stopped power workers from accessing their equipment . Jets: Firefighters deployed multiple hoses to combat the blaze which wreaked havoc on the area . Exhausted: Firefighters looked tired as they took a break after working at the scene for hours . Blocked: Roads were closed in the wake of the fire, whose cause is still unknown . UK Power Networks said that 100 staff had worked through the night to restore electricity to the area, but it is not known when buildings will regain power. A spokesman said: 'A major gas fire in an underground tunnel is still burning so we cannot yet access our equipment. 'Our engineers have restored power to 2,000 customers and the remaining 1,100 will regain power through generators and cable works as soon as possible. 'We had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today. 'We are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated. The cause of the incident is being investigated.' Fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer, and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses. Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control. 'This has been a technically difficult incident to tackle,' he said. 'The reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night, the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished. 'However, the fire is contained and we are making steady progress and working with the utility companies and the police to bring this incident to a close.' Works: More than 100 power workers were deployed to restore electricity to businesses in central London . Disruption: The road closures were said to have caused severe traffic jams in the surrounding area . Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said the blaze was 'a technically difficult incident to tackle' Deserted: The Holborn area was emptied of workers and shoppers thanks to the disruption . Closure: Shops had signs in their windows apologising for the inconvenience . One council boss warned that there was a 'worrying trend' of pavements exploding in central London and said that businesses had been hit by the accidents. 'We do not fully yet know what caused the fire in Holborn on Wednesday,' said Richard Beddoe of Westminster Council. 'However, pavements have exploded in central London previously and it is a very worrying trend. 'Our message remains the same - we want to see better investment in the capital's infrastructure, as it benefits the whole UK. 'We are relieved to hear that there were no serious casualties, but the losses to big businesses in the West End, due to poor infrastructure, is just not acceptable. We want to see action.' In July, Piccadilly Circus was closed after an electrical fault beneath a manhole cover caused an explosion which resulted in a lorry catching fire. Meanwhile, in February last year, 50 people were evacuated from a street in north London after a pavement burst into flames. And in April 2013, a fireball burst from a pavement in Pimlico Road, central London, narrowly missing a passer-by standing yards away. A UK Power Networks spokesman said: 'There have been a small number of incidents disturbing pavements over recent years, caused by a variety of reasons and affecting utility infrastructures underground.' Blackout: Power was knocked out across the area and more than 1,000 buildings remain without electricity . Dramatic: This aerial image shows how a wide area of London was left without power . Scene: These file photos show tunnels under Holborn near to where the fire broke out . Smoke: More than 2,000 workers were forced to flee their central London workplaces . Among the buildings affected by the fire is the Royal Courts of Justice, home to the High Court and Court of Appeal, which was due to remain closed all day. Somerset House, the London School of Economics and the London Transport Museum were closed, while the English National Ballet cancelled its planned matinée performances of Swan Lake. One of the offices affected by the fire was that of HM Inspectorate of Prisons, which is closed as a result of the power cut. Gillian Perham, 54, lives near the fire and said there had been similar incidents in recent years. 'There was an exploding pavement not far from here last year,' she said. 'We are fed up with it. I'm terrified it's going to happen when I'm near one.' At one point yesterday, 70 firefighters and 10 engines were at the scene of the blaze, which forced a number of West End theatres to cancel shows last night, including The Lion King, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Play That Goes Wrong. In a separate incident, 15 engines were called to a fire on an industrial unit in north London.","Main roads in Holborn are closed more than 24 hours after fire broke out .

44,9b678de1b0800ff21214177b115f73ff0b9db2ea,"Former Queens Park Rangers chairman Gianni Paladini has registered as a director of a new Bradford City holding company in what appears to be the first move towards taking control at Valley Parade. Paladini has been searching for a way back into football since he left Loftus Road in 2011 and has attempted to buy Birmingham City from Carson Yeung. The Italian seems to have enjoyed more success in West Yorkshire where he has forged an official link to Bradford, a club which has been one of the great success stories of the season. Former QPR chief Gianni Paladini appears to be keen on taking over the reins at League One side Bradford . Bradford's most memorable moment of the season came during their shock FA Cup win over Chelsea . Phil Parkinson’s team captured the imagination of fans across the nation when they fought back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Chelsea in the FA Cup and went on to beat Sunderland before losing in a quarter-final replay at Reading. Those FA Cup exploits came against a backdrop of colourful and passionate support. They took 8,000 supporters to Stamford Bridge and generated a brilliant atmosphere for the tie at home to Sunderland. It was a reminder of the club’s enormous potential, having been led out of the doldrums of League Two and administration by chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn, with the help of Parkinson’s managerial skill. Lawn has spoken of the need to attract new investment and Paladini is registered as the sole director of Bradford City (Holdings) Limited, set up in February. The company was originally set up with Paladini and Mauro Milanese named as directors but Milanese’s name has been removed. Paladini has previously made an attempt to buy Birmingham from Carson Yeung (pictured) Milanese is a former centre half who played for several Italian clubs and had one year at QPR during a long playing career and briefly managed Leyton Orient last year. Paladini’s ambitions to return to football are well documented. As well as trying to buy Birmingham, he has been linked possible takeovers at Millwall and Reading. Bradford were beaten 6-0 at home by Bristol City on Tuesday, which confirmed Bristol City’s promotion to the Championship and virtually ended Bradford’s hopes of capping an incredible season by reaching the play-offs. Paladini spent eight years at QPR, seizing control after a complicated takeover in 2003 and attracting investment from billionaires Lakshmi Mittal and F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore. He left his role at Loftus Road in 2011 following the takeover by Tony Fernandes.","Gianni Paladini has registered as director of Bradford's holding company .

After losing by the same scoreline on Easter Monday, Aitor Karanka's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford, who also missed a late penalty. But with the top three sides all winning, Boro stayed fourth in the Sky Bet Championship table. Lee Tomlin (centre) scored the opening goal in Middlesbrough's 2-0 win at home to Rotherham on Saturday . Tomlin (centre) is mobbed by his Middlesbrough team-mates after his fine solo effort gives them the lead . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Gibson, Ayala (Woodgate, 70), Friend, Clayton (Whitehead, 79),  Forshaw,  Adomah, Tomlin (Nsue Lopez, 85),  Bamford, Garcia Martinez. Subs not used: Ripley, Vossen, Amorebieta, Wildschut . Goals: Tomlin 50, Bamford 66 .

Booked: Arnason, Frecklington . Referee: Iain Williamson . Attendance: 19,537 . After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford (left) doubled the Teesiders' lead on 66 minutes with a cool left-footed finish . The 21-year-old celebrates his strike, taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far . But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post. Sub Emilio Nsue should have made it three with two minutes to go when he had an open goal but his shot was deflected just wide. And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw's ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar. Bamford should have bagged his 17th goal of the season when Richard Wood brought Kike down in the area, but the forward's poor spot-kick was saved by Martinez. However, the on loan Chelsea star failed to add to his tally late on when he saw his penalty saved .","Lee Tomlin's superb solo effort gave Middlesbrough a 50th minute lead .

James May, 52, revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal by ordering a rare  £200,000 Ferrari before Clarkson's sacking after an infamous 'fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon. May says he had ordered the last ever Ferrari 458 Speciale - in bright orange - while the 'draft version' of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk 'with only a few details to resolve'. But after Clarkson punched Tymon in a rage over a hot meal, the offer was taken off the table. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (right) and his Top Gear colleagues had been on the brink of a lucrative new contract when Clarkson's infamous 'fracas' led to the offer being taken away . May revealed that he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal while the contract was still being finalised by ordering a £200,000 Ferrari 458 Speciale in bright orange (pictured) The presenter said the trio had planned to continue making the show until the end of the new contract before leaving 'with dignity'. But Clarkson, 55, was sensationally sacked by the BBC last month and Richard Hammond, 45, joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear this week. Writing in a column for the Sunday Times, May said: 'There we were, all three of us, on the brink of a new three-year contract to make Top Gear, after which we would definitely chuck it in with dignity and hand the reins to a new generation, assuming we were still alive . 'There were a few details to resolve about time frames and other mundane stuff, but the groaning draft version of this document was actually sitting on my desk. 'This was a great privilege and a once-in-a-lifetime event; an invitation to continue presenting the world's biggest TV show for – let's not be shy – a handsome salary.' The three men had planned to stay on for another three years before quitting 'with dignity' until Clarkson was sensationally sacked after punching show producer Oisin Tymon (pictured) On the future, he remained vague, suggested the three may be reunited on screen or go in separate directions. Now, May admits ordering a brand new Ferrari is a 'strange' thing for an unemployed person to do, but insists he has no regrets, describing the purchase as a once-in-lifetime opportunity. He acknowledged the supercar was an extravagant purchase at £208,090 but that 'it was better than money in the bank'. Meanwhile, Clarkson was seen talking himself out of a parking ticket for his bright green Lamborghini yesterday after leaving it parked on yellow lines in London. Elsewhere, Hammond told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be 'exciting' for the three men, but refused to speculate further on the future of Top Gear. He said: 'Everybody knows what's happened. That's all been in the news. The future, nobody knows yet do they? 'And I cannot and won't speculate further than that. So don't know, let's see. It'll be exciting whatever.' There is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster. Producer Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would 'not be pursuing the matter any further.'

Finn was overlooked for the West Indies tour, but has spent time since the World Cup working on his run-up – and watching videos of his best spells as a reminder of why he became the youngest English bowler to take 50 Test wickets. ‘I’ve had my trials and tribulations over the last 12 months,’ he said. ‘But I feel everything at the crease is as I want it to be.

48,40aaac4df33e238efdecaed02c9adaa916975c2e,"Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 to make it back-to-back wins for the first time since last June. Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat-trick puts him out in front as Super League's most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through, only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock-on. What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break, Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40-metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O'Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes, who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half, gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner, but it proved no more than a consolation.","Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching display .

For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015, some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit, although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50, reports The Washington Post. 'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?' While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt - especially for people with high blood pressure - can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement. 'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services has said that the federal guidelines are considering comments from the public and the advice of its science panel.","Current federal government guidelines dictate the people should limit their salt intake to 2,300 milligrams .
Scientists now believe a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks .

Driver told the informant that he had gotten into a fight with the inmate and that he and Moran wanted him ""six feet under,"" according to court documents.

The Spaniard has been linked with the managerial job at Sampdoria after it emerged that Sinisa Mihajlovic - the current Blucerchiati boss - is being lined up to replace Benitez at Napoli. But Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero has taken inspiration from a favourite chant of the Goodison Park and Old Trafford terraces, appearing to quash rumours that a job swap is imminent. Napoli manager Rafael Benitez jokes with Switzerland Gokhan Inler (right) during a training session . Benitez challenges  Argentinian forward Gonzalo Higuain during a training session earlier today . 'I could take Benitez, but I'd have to take him to see a dietician first,' Ferrero told Radio Crc. 'Anyway, if Mihajlovic does leave, I've already got a replacement. You all say he's leaving, even if I don't know anything about it. 'As far as I am concerned, he's staying. If he were to leave, I'd know who to replace him with. Paulo Sousa's not going to be Sampdoria's next coach, it will be [Italian comedy actor] Lino Banfi.' Sampdoria travel to face Napoli on Sunday trailing Benitez's side by three points, but Ferrero said he would rather keep hold of the Serbian Mihajlovic, who has guided the Genoa-based club from relegation candidates to European contenders in 18 months. 'Napoli would not be taking a step backwards if they were to get Mihajlovic,' Ferrero said. 'I'm talking from my experience and I can say that Sinisa's a man of great sensitivity, a great professional and a great worker. 'He arrives two hours before training and he leaves two hours after. Above everything, he's got incredible ability and if he does leave, then I'm sure whoever gets him will be hitting the jackpot.

Lord Prescott, whose letters are separate to those due to be released, said that while he is 'not a raving loyalist', he has 'a lot of time for Charles' who he described as a passionate environmentalist. He said while he listens to the views of everyone who contacts him on political matters, he makes his own decisions. The former Labour minister, writing in the Sunday Mirror, said: ' Charles has an awful lot to offer this country. 'And if he wants to serve his subjects by helping young people into work, combating climate change and building sustainable communities, he can write as many damn letters as he likes.' Lord Prescott published extracts from two letters he received from the Prince - including one expressing his sadness at the death of the Labour politician's mother. The Labour peer said the notes proved 'the measure of the man'. He said: 'They show he has nothing to hide and he shouldn't be worried about publication.' The first letter is a typed ­invitation to a meeting of Regional­ ­Development Agency leaders in 1999. Charles says it would be 'splendid' to see Lord Prescott. The second is more personal and was written in the Prince's ­distinctive handwriting in 2003. It expresses sadness at the death of Lord Prescott's mother. The Prince opens by joking that he has 'been overdoing the quota' of letters to the Deputy PM. Prince Charles - with the Duchess of Cornwall at Ascot races last week - does a lot of good for the country, according to the former Labour minister Lord Prescott . But despite this – and the 'trouble' the press would give him – he goes on to express his sadness and says his 'heart goes out' to the politician. He added: 'I did receive letters from the prince when I was in government but they had no effect on any policy. People say he shouldn't be writing to ministers but he's quite entitled to express his opinion. 'Politicians are lobbied all the time by individuals and groups and none of them would allow a letter – even from Prince Charles – to unduly ­influence them.' Prince Charles has long been accused of 'bombarding' ministers with 'black spider' memos attacking government policy. His letters are so-named after his distinctive handwriting and abundant use of underlining and exclamation marks. Both  Clarence House and the Prime Minister expressed disappointment after the court ruling. The notes reflect,  according to previous attorney general Dominic Grieve, the prince's 'most deeply held personal views and beliefs'.","Ex deputy PM said there was no problem with Charles writing to ministers .
Admitted Charles had sent him a lot of letters while he was in government .
Released two, including one condolence letter over death of his mother .

Fashion fans who follow many of the top bloggers on Instagram experienced an extreme case of déjà vu over the weekend after the same dress was modelled by no less than 50 fashionistas .

To convince that many fashionistas - including Caitlin Lindquist and Rachel Lynch - to promote your new line is extremely rare but Lord & Taylor didn’t leave anything to chance and the company has admitted that it paid the bloggers to wear the paisley-print, handkerchief-hem summer dress. Adweek reports that the bloggers received ‘unspecified compensation’ in return for giving the dress their seal of approval. ‘The goal was to make [the potential customer] stop in her feed and ask why all her favorite bloggers are wearing this dress, and what is Design Lab? Using Instagram as that vehicle is a logical choice, especially when it comes to fashion,’ said Lord & Taylor's CMO Michael Crotty. Many of the posts generated more than 1,000 Likes each, with several surpassing 5,000 Likes and some reaching rarified levels like 13,000 Likes.

The Lord & Taylor deal highlights the gray area of bloggers receiving payment for promoting some goods and services, while others they lend their credability to for free. While newspapers and websites such as the Daily Mail Online have to be upfront and clearly state when something is paid for content, the rules are less stringent on social media. Many celebrities now promote products and luxury brands via Twitter in return for either payment or freebies. Rap star Snoop Dogg and actress Lindsay Lohan are among the famous names who have been paid by big businesses to promote products to their massive Twitter followings. In leaked Sony emails in December, it was revealed that comedian Kevin Hart had been paid $2 million to send out tweets to his 14.8 million followers promoting The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington, and the Idris Elba film No Good Deed. 'Make sure yo go support my Brother @willpowerpacker this weekend by seeing ""No Good Deed"" .... @TherealTaraji & Idris kill this movie!' wrote the actor on September 12.

He said his ire had been raised because the official had been in his line-of-sight as he was preparing to play his shot. 'We were being timed (for slow play), which I can appreciate,' Willett said after carding a one-under 71 at Augusta National.

The firm's latest update automatically shows the latest pictures posted to Facebook's site. Tinder also said it had improved its mutual friends feature. Scroll down for video . Tinder will now display the last 34 pictures of a person's Instagram feed - and allow users to see more. Simply open Tinder, go to your new profile, and connect it to your Instagram account with a single tap - your Tinder profile will automatically start displaying your recent Instagram photos. Tinder only displays the last 34 photos, users can venture out to the app for a look at the full library. 'You asked, we listened,' the firm said. 'We’ve made some exciting new changes to your Tinder profile including a slick, new Instagram integration and more common friends.' The firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their Instagram user name in their profile. 'Now there’s no need to put your Instagram handle in your profile description to tell your story (we got sick of having to do that, too).' It also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your Instagram feed know it was part of a dating profile. 'And in case you were wondering, Tinder won’t post anything to Instagram on your behalf or alter your existing Instagram privacy settings.' Tinder has overhauled its profile as part of the Instagram integration - and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests . The firm has also used Facebook to boost its 'mutual friends' feature. Tinder now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches. 'This adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe,' Tinder claims. It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look, expanding the number of interests people can add. Earlier this month Tinder rolled out ‘Tinder Plus’, a premium service allowing people to ‘undo’ a like or change their location. A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services. Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base. The study, carried out by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app. Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. But now they have set a limit on the number of ‘likes’ a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100. When a user reaches this limit, the app tells them ‘You’re Out of Likes’, and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again. But, below this clock, a big red button says ‘Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus’. A price is then shown. But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts. It seems the prices range from around £1.49 a month to as high as £14.99 - but the reasons why are not clear. This means some users will pay £17.88 a year for Tinder Plus - but others, in the upper price category, will have to fork out a whopping £179.88 a year. This equates to some users inadvertently paying £162 more than others over the course of a year. Speaking to MailOnline, Rosette Pambakian, Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder, told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release. 'We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally,' she said. 'The UK is one of our test markets, so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points.' However, it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user - and whether it is based on location or activity. In addition, Tinder has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service.","Tinder only displays the last 34 photos - but users can easily see more .

Mike Heatlie, 42, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney outside a nightclub in Edinburgh because she did not give him a cigarette. Heatlie, from Edinburgh, was once voted as one of the city's most eligible bachelors and claims to have helped train Stefani before her 2009 U.S tour. At the time, she described him as 'Superman'. Personal trainer Mike Heatlie, 42, (left), who claims to have previously work with Gwen Stefani, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney, 43, (right) outside a nightclub in Edinburgh . But Ms McCartney is now facing a £7,000 dental bill and says she is too frightened to leave her home after being assaulted by the personal trainer. He pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in March to the attack. He is due to appear again on April 22 for sentencing. Speaking for the first time about the attack, Ms McCartney, a legal PA from Greenbank in Edinburgh, said: 'I used to love going out on Saturday nights. But since the attack I have been very wary and like to be home by a certain time. 'I don't like to go out to nightclubs now and I get very panicky in crowds after this unprovoked attack. 'I'm on sleeping tablets from a doctor because I don't sleep at all. I still have this constant reminder and feel I can't move on because I still have the injuries from that night. I'm reminded every day of this attack.' Ms McCartney said the incident unfolded after Heatlie approached her while she was with a friend outside The Jam House club in March last year. The Edinburgh-based trainer apparently worked on and off with the No Doubt singer (pictured) since 1997 . A testimony which claims to be from Stefani appears on Heatlie's website, which describes him as 'completely passionate' and a 'wonderful motivator' He asked the pair for a cigarette but neither woman had one to give him. He then lashed out and punched her, she said. Ms McCartney said she still suffers from numbness and aching in her mouth. She is also due to have expensive and painful dental work, over the next few months. Heatlie (pictured above) pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to the attack . Speaking about the incident, Heatlie said: 'This was an unfortunate incident that occurred last year. 'I have been in touch with Ms McCartney and the situation is now very amicable and both parties, I'm sure, would like to move on from it.' In a text message, which Ms McCartney said had been sent by Heatlie to her partner, the trainer wrote: 'Please pass on my sincerest apologies to your partner Fiona, I wanted to get in touch but obviously couldn't with the case proceedings. 'This incident, that I have virtually no memory of, has turned my life upside down and I can't imagine how it has impacted Fiona's. 'I am so sorry, this is completely out of character for me, I've never been involved in a violent incident in my adult life.' Heatlie used an endorsement from Stefani to help promote his new studio when it opened six years ago. At the time, she described Heatlie as being 'completely passionate about health and fitness'. She said: 'I’m so happy for Mike that he’s opening his own studio. I know it will be a huge success. I can’t wait to start working with him again in preparation for our summer tour.

A British climber has cheated death on Everest for the second time in a year, it emerged last night. As rescuers faced a desperate race against time to airlift stranded climbers off the world's highest peak after the devastating earthquake on Saturday night, Selina Dicker described how she ran for her life as a wall of snow and ice tore through Base Camp. Miss Dicker, 38, from London, was at the same camp on April 18 last year when an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas who were climbing ahead of her group. The tragedy forced Miss Dicker, head of lending for finance company Europa Capital Mezzanine, to abandon her first attempt on the summit. Miss Dicker – who was in the same climbing party as Google executive Dan Fredinburg, who died in Saturday's avalanche – described the ordeal in a satellite phone call to her mother Gail Dicker at her home in Ranworth, Norfolk. Mrs Dicker, 61, said: 'She's a very lucky girl. I just want to see her home. Others in her group tried to out-run it and one of them was killed and two were seriously hurt.' Miss Dicker, who was born with a cleft palate, had been trying to raise £45,000 for Operation Smile, which provides surgery for children with the condition. Her mother said: 'She wanted to go back and have another go. I tried to talk her out of it as any mother would, but she is a determined and independent woman of 38 and you cannot tell them what to do. 'I am hoping her father will talk her out of it if she wants to go back again. She listens to him more than me.' Six helicopters have been flying perilous rescue missions since the earthquake triggered a 'tsunami' of ice and rock which crushed Base Camp, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens more. Bad weather, continued aftershocks, and poor communication have scuppered subsequent trips, leaving hundreds stranded. Climber Alex Staniforth, 19, from Chester, said on Twitter that he was 'very lucky to be alive' after being evacuated to Base Camp. But while some climbers were able to tweet and update their Facebook pages, others were cut off from communications, leaving worried families in Britain desperate for news. Up to 70 Britons are unaccounted for. Traveller Samuel Beckett, 23, from Leicester, is missing and his father Martin said: 'We have not heard anything. We just keep watching the news and keep looking through the social media sites.' Among the other stories emerging from the disaster zone were: . Miss Dicker, from Fulham, southwest London,  escaped the wall of snow and rocks as it tore through the Everest base camp on Saturday morning, by running for her life and seeking shelter from a ridge .

Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain: 'All Alex keeps talking about is her need for a glass of wine. Some of us are more chilled out than others.' As the adventurous couple, both 28, spent a third night halfway up Everest, Alex's sister Liz Schneider, 23, said: 'The ordeal isn't over. They have not been able to get off yet. 'We are just keeping our fingers crossed and hoping they can get to safety soon.' Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain . Video has emerged of the moment the earthquake hit Mount Everest and triggered a massive avalanche . The Chappattes, who married two weeks ago in Chelsea, London, tweeted earlier yesterday: 'Trying to get a chopper.' They then wrote 'fog creeping up the valley'. The newlyweds have described how they saw an 'avalanche coming straight at us' and were blown over by a blast of wind. They scrambled to shelter behind other tents and had to keep making air holes in the snow to breathe as the avalanche engulfed them. DESPERATE SOS FROM MISSING TREKKER . The family of a missing British woman has received an SOS message saying her group is trapped without food and water and in desperate need of medical assistance. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Friday. One of her fellow walkers – from South Africa – managed to send a message to his mother saying the group needed help. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Frida . Susannah's sister Nina, 25, from Bath, Somerset, said: 'Someone has managed to text or something saying they are stuck in an area with 15 other trekkers. They have sent the co-ordinates but said in the message that some are injured and that they don't have any food or water and that they really need to be rescued. They have said they need a helicopter to get out. 'All the roads around them are ruined and they can't get out. We are frantically trying to work out a way of reaching her and getting her help.' THE PHONE CALLS...AND THE GRIM SILENCE . Gap-year volunteer Anna Buchanan, 18, from New Malden, was missing for more than 24 hours until she contacted her distraught mother Pauline, who said: 'As I spoke to her there was another tremor. Everyone started screaming, it was just awful.' Saad Hikmet, from Mill Hill, whose son Jonathan, 25, has not been heard of since the disaster, said: 'He was on a trek of Northern Nepal with yoga instructors and they've been going around for a month. Now we just want to know that he's safe.' Philip Green, 30, originally from St John's Wood, London, was still missing yesterday. His brother Rob said: 'Obviously we are extremely worried at the moment. It's a nightmare for us.' Barbara and Ian Nightingale, who are from Nottingham and in their 60s, were believed to be trekking in Nepal at the time of the quake. A couple from Carshalton in south London – Chloe Pincho and Brennan White – were trekking up Everest at the time of the disaster, but last night made contact. Pensioner Ann McNeil, from New Milton, Hampshire, was on an adventure holiday with her two brothers. Daughter Karen Korvin, 40, had set up an urgent appeal for information and announced last night that they had been found. She wrote online: 'I love you, Mum, please come home safely.' Leicester University has paid tribute to post-graduate medical student Marisa Eve Girawong, from New Jersey in the United States, who was killed in the tragedy. Holby City actress Catherine Russell tweeted a picture of a relative, Mike Russell, who was missing. The 42-year-old has since been found. Climbers could be seen sprinting away from the wall of snow and taking refuge in their tents at base camp . ALTITUDE SICKNESS SAVES AMANDA HOLDEN'S SISTER . Amanda Holden said her sister was trapped on the mountain and may have been saved because she had altitude sickness. The Britain's Got Talent judge said Debbie Holden had sent a text message to let her family know she had survived the avalanche. Miss Holden said of her sister, a scuba-diving instructor: 'It's awful, I can barely speak. I'm still quite numb. It's hard to take in what an awful situation it is in Nepal.' She said Debbie had not yet reached Base Camp, where the avalanche struck, because she had been ill and had stopped to recover.

60,23052beb2829d49cdbbf265dacb09344585becd0,"In a retweet on Thursday, a staffer to real estate magnate Donald Trump managed to capture the coarsest background conversations Americans are having about former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's personal baggage. He may now be looking for a new job. 'If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband,' a Texas-cowgirl college student tweeted, 'what makes her think she can satisfy America?' When someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included Trump's Twitter handle in the message, one of the billionaire's staffers retweeted it for him – to his audience of 2.8 million people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . THE INTERNET IS FOREVER: A social media staffer to Donald Trump retweeted an off-color jab at Hillary Clinton on Thursday before the boss deleted it . Trump, a multibillionaire who's considering a presidential run, will be in New Hampshire on Saturday – where the episode will likely come up . SATISFIED? Bill Clinton (left) was a famous lothario during his presidency, even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed: Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee, not a fat-fingered CEO, who was responsible. 'Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump’s various social media platforms.' 'As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it,' the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton's once-strained relationship with her philandering husband isn't likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race, but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister, a Texas equestrian champion, originated the line about Hillary Clinton's alleged inability to 'satisfy' her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife, going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler's story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister, who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill, deleted it just before noon on Friday, along with a second message. 'Sry to those offended by me merely making a political joke,' she had tweeted in a follow-up. 'Get some rest, there are more important things in the world to be worried about.' She assured Daily Mail Online in an email that no one fro, the Trump camp had asked her to delete the tweets. 'I deleted them by choice because of the negative backlash I was receiving,' she said. 'I didn't even know Donald Trump had retweeted it until about an hour ago.' Burmeister confirmed to Daily Mail Online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash . She originally offered an apology to people who were offended, but it apparently wasn't enough for some . Burmeister is no stranger to media attention. A world champion equestrian, she also had a bit part last year in an episode of the reboot of the 'Dallas' TV drama. And she's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at Tarleton State University in Texas, according to her social media profiles. Trump's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky Twitter user hadn't made a screen capture on his phone. 'Hey @RealDonaldTrump – In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted,' he wrote, 'I got it right here.' Hillary Clinton's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.","Sawyer Burmeister, a horse-riding champion and sometimes actress, tweeted the barb on Thursday evening .

Four Turkish soldiers also were wounded in the fighting that took place in the eastern city of Agri, the armed forces said in a written statement. The Kurdish separatists opened fire from a long distance, targeting Turkish soldiers who were securing an area in Agri ahead of a spring festival, CNN Turk reported. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu condemned the violence and said via Twitter that ""the appropriate answer to the heinous attack in Agri is being given by the Turkish armed forces."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also harshly condemned the attack, describing it as the Kurdish separatists' attempt to ""intervene in the resolution process (with the Kurds) in our country."" Last month, Abdullah Ocalan, longtime leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), called from his jail cell for the violence to end. In a historic letter, he urged fighters under his command to lay down their arms, stop their war against the Turkish state and join a ""congress"" to focus on the future. Since the first incidents more than three decades ago, an estimated 40,000 lives have been lost. The conflict has been, some say, a battle by activists among Turkey's Kurdish minority for independence. It has been, others say, a guerrilla war by rebels who have punctuated their campaign with terrorist acts. About a fifth of Turkey's population is Kurdish -- a minority long living under cultural oppression, most of them in the underdeveloped southeastern part of Turkey.

63,06b6e2a8279feb2c6be3c3b8a2a7052df536a39a,"An Israeli geologist claims he has ‘confirmed’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem. After extensive chemical tests, Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood. The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place. Scroll down for video . After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary (pictured) – a 1st-century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood . According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including ‘Judah, son of Jesus’ and his wife, named Mary. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus,The Jerusalem Post reported. Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph'. Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. Joseph, Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population. However, a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus (a portrait is pictured) The long-disputed long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood (marked) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago . Probing this connection, Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries, including the James Ossuary, which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription, ‘James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus’. The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead. But it stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side. The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus, . The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged. The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago'. Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. The owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris, but he was later found innocent. Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all. Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time. He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries – 15 of which were from unrelated tombs – and found that traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb. The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘Rendzina’ soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry. Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries, effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time. Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the ‘holy’ location. Bones were discovered there in ossuaries, or chalk boxes, including one that bears the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph' with others bearing the names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. Here an inscription that says 'Yoseph' on an ossuary . Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection (portrayed in this tapestry) which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual . Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. A mosaic of Christ is shown . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. David Fitzgerald told MailOnline: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years'. The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is shown . 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different ""Lord's suppers"" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post: ‘This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth.’ Dr Shumron told The New York Times: ‘I think I’ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Talpiot Tomb.’ The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel, added: ‘ The evidence is beyond what I expected.’ The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church, but insist the research is scientific and not theological. Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection, which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual. The Talpiot tomb is now sealed under a concrete slab, while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The James Ossuary is kept in a secret location by its owner, who lives in Tel Aviv.","Geologist ran 150 chemical tests on ossuaries and 'Jesus Family tomb'

65,4776b2e669e75793a4ac2a5c5a9b718070d39007,"Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor-made for a power-sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon's manifesto overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total £180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a ‘strong team’ of SNP MPs in Westminster would help ‘rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected’. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. ‘We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland’s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn’t leave the UK but lead the UK,’ she said. ‘So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland’s voice shouldn’t be heard or that Scotland’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.’ However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today’s launch over her plans for ‘full fiscal autonomy’ or effective ‘home rule’, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a ‘fiscally autonomous’ Scotland would have a £7.6billion black hole in its finances.","Nicola Sturgeon will today unveil SNP manifesto as a 'bid to lead the UK'

66,d604fabaf467a3c3e29e2314304c9cadedb31514,"Obese workers are 'lazy' and 'unable to fulfil their roles' and as a result are less likely to be hired, a new survey has revealed. Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight. Among the reasons given were that overweight workers 'are unable to play a full role in the business', 'they're lazy', and 'they wouldn't be able to do the job required', the research shows. Beverley Sunderland, managing director, at Crosslands Employment Solicitors, who commissioned the research, said: 'Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers.' A survey of 1,000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant, fearing 'they're lazy', and 'unable to fulfil their roles as required', because of their weight . The findings come in the wake of a European court case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person... on an equal basis with other workers', when doing their job. Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity. According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9. If a person's BMI is 25 to 29.9, they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese. Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a BMI of more than 40 – could be considered a disability. But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'. It stated: 'It is for the national court to determine whether [an individual's] obesity falls within the definition of 'disability'.' Ms Sunderland said following the case, 'it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight'. 'But the law is on your side, as discrimination law warns against making ""stereotypical assumptions"" at every stage of the recruitment process and this applies to both existing employees, or people applying for a job,' she added. Given the ruling at the European Courts of Justice, employers now have to find way to accommodate obese workers who fall within this definition of 'disability', while larger job applicants need to ensure they are not discriminated against, Ms Sunderland said. Critics at the time warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout. Companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories, including providing: . The survey revealed 61 per cent of employers were worried about the potential costs to the business of accommodating the side effects of overweight staff. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability, after a case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, pictured, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat . Sixty-three per cent also cited a fear of being taken to court on grounds of discrimination, if the disability needs of obese workers were not met. Just over a quarter (26 per cent) said they were less inclined to hire obese people due to their lack of awareness of the laws linked to employing overweight workers. Yet the lack of understanding of the law could land employers in hot water, Ms Sunderland warned. More than half of employers questioned were unaware that if an obese person tells an employer about their long-term conditions at interview and the company does not employ them, the applicant could try to claim disability discrimination on the basis their obesity prevented them being employed.","Survey of 1,000 firms showed half are less inclined to recruit obese people .

Arsenal are unlikely to be the only club in the race to land Sterling if Liverpool fail to resolve the current contract impasse. Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea are monitoring Sterling's contract talks closely.

Arsene Wenger's side were far from their best, but Aaron Ramsey's early goal put them ahead and Burnley, for all their endeavour, didn't create too many clear-cut chances. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Burnley . Tom Heaton: Saved well from Ozil in the build-up to Arsenal’s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear. 7 . Kieran Trippier: Forced Ospina into a good save with a curling free-kick and delivered well from corners. 6 . Jason Shackell: At fault for Arsenal’s opener as his sloppy pass gave possession away cheaply. 5.5 . Michael Duff: The 37-year-old did a good job of keeping Giroud under wraps and provided a threat from corners. 6.5 . Ben Mee: Made a superb block to deny Ramsey a second after a brilliant lobbed pass from Ozil. 7 . Ben Mee was booked in the first half for a blatant block on Aaron Ramsey, but responded well . Michael Duff goes up to challenge Arsenal's in-form striker Olivier Giroud during the hard-fought encounter . George Boyd: Full of running as ever but failed to trouble Arsenal when in possession of the ball. 6 . Scott Arfield: Another full of industry and almost provided an assist for Ings with a clever lob. 6 . David Jones: Brought calmness and quality to Burnley’s midfield but could not find a killer pass. 6.5 . Ashley Barnes: Wide left is not his favoured position but put Bellerin under pressure with and intense work ethic. 6 . Danny Ings: Starved action but went close with an acrobatic effort from Arfield’s chip into the box. 6 . Sam Vokes: Saw an early chance go begging when he fired at Ospina from close range. 6 . Subs: Taylor (for David Jones) 90 . George Boyd, who missed a great chance for Burnley on the half-volley, tackles Francis Coquelin . Scott Arfield tries to get to grips with Mesut Ozil as Burnley worked exceptionally hard against Arsenal . Arsenal . David Ospina: Was perhaps busier than he might have expected and had to make decent saves to deny Vokes and Trippier. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Faded after a bright start. Pinned back by Barnes’ aggressive closing down. Nutmegged by Mee. 6 . Laurent Koscielny: Kept a close eye on Danny Ings and restricted the Burnley top-scorer to just one chance. 7 . Per Mertesacker: Given a good, physical battle by Vokes and just about came out on top. 7 . Hector Bellerin is chopped down by Ashley Barnes as Burnley targeted the young Spanish full back . Laurent Koscielny suffered a few difficult moments as Arsenal sought to continue their excellent form . Nacho Monreal: Made a vital interception and clearance to thwart a chance for Ings. 6 . Francis Coquelin: Has developed into a key member of Arsenal’s midfield and did another fine job as the anchor man.7.5 . Mesut Ozil: Less effective than he was against Liverpool, with only flashes of brilliance. 6 . Aaron Ramsey: Applied the finishing touch after a goalmouth scramble to get the Gunners noses in front. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey fires home to put Arsenal ahead despite several Burnley defenders' best efforts . Santi Cazorla: Left his shooting boots in north London. The Spaniard whipped a free-kick narrowly wide and sent an ambitious left-foot volley over the bar. 6 . Alexis Sanchez: Saw plenty of the ball in the wide left channel but Burnley coped well to nullify the Chilean’s threat. 6 . Olivier Giroud: Marked out of the game by Burnley’s centre-backs and hardly had a kick before being replaced. 5 . Subs: Welbeck for Giroud (81), Chambers for Sanchez (90) Referee: Mike Dean 6.5 .

And now, Rita Ora - who is only 24 and has already made the transition from a Kosovan-born fledgling singer to one of the globe's most successful stars - has channeled her passion for fashion into a new adidas range. For her latest collaboration with adidas Originals, Rita has taken the brand's classics and put her own bold spin on them. The result? A collection that is as daring and vibrant as the designer herself. Scroll down for video . Rita Ora has channeled her passion for fashion into a new adidas range, so FEMAIL caught up with the global star to find out her influences and plans for the future . Speaking to FEMAIL about the inspiration behind her new range, which is emblazoned with graphic dragon prints and lands on May 1, Rita said: 'The Dragon print is all about my love of travel and soaking up different cultures. The print itself is inspired by Asian culture and one of its most recognisable symbols. 'I’ve contrasted that with the fit, basketball style cuts, which were inspired by American culture. My White Smoke pack is about the body-mind-soul connection, about taking a moment for reflection. The graphic comes from the visual smoke creates when burning incense.' The talented star, who also recently unveiled a beauty range for Rimmel, couldn't be happier with the final result. She said: 'I love being able to go into design meetings with all these crazy ideas and then be able to create a product that hasn’t existed before.

Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises there’s 'a little something for everyone'. 'Each one of my packs has a different cut and style to it,' she explained. 'I’m more of a tomboy myself but I also love to get dressed up and wear a big dress, so my designs embody that contrast. 'I’m always about wearing what looks and feels good to you, not about following trends. So I try to create clothing that fits that, allowing the person wearing it to make it their own however it fits their own personal style.' Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises the range, pictured, offers 'a little something for everyone' Citing Marilyn Monroe as her ultimate postergirl, Rita explains that her style has evolved as a result of her transatlantic career. 'I’ve always loved that London street style, but I’ve started to fuse it with a more American style the more time I’ve spent here,' she said. 'But UK or US, I’ve always been a sneakerhead. Adidas has always been a staple in my closet, so it was a natural fit for me to collaborate with them, I’m just grateful they wanted to work with me!'.

So does she ever have a day off and what does she get up to? 'Whenever I have a day off, I spend the day in my bed, watching movies, in my pyjamas, eating takeaway,' she revealed. 'I guess it’s probably fortunate that I don’t have too many days off, but I always like to take full advantage of any down time I can get.' Thanks to her countless projects and array of starry friends, it seems that The Voice coach is taking over the world.  'Aw, thank you!,' she replied. 'It’s great to be able to give a try to so many different things. 'I’m just starting to get more into the Hollywood movie world, so I’d love to continue down that path.

The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider is widely regarded by many as the most beautiful convertible ever made. But it is best known for that infamous scene in the 1986 teen comedy starring Matthew Broderick. The car, in classic Ferrari red, was the pride and joy of the father of Ferris Bueller's best friend Cameron in the movie. That was until the friends take the model out for a spin which results in the convertible accidentally smashing through its glass showroom doors into the ravine below. A stunning Ferrari - which is almost identical to the model driven in cult eighties classic film Ferris Bueller's Day Off is up for auction . The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider (pictured) is regarded by many as the most beautiful convertible ever made . But its most famous moment came it was used as the car for the 1986 teen comedy Ferris Bueller, starring Matthew Broderick . In the movie, Ferris took best friend Cameron's dad's red model out without permission but the car eventually trashed . You killed the car: In one of the film world's best-known scenes, the beloved Ferrari crashes into the ravine below after Cameron accidentally knocks it off the jack . This car, however, is in significantly better condition and has recently undergone a full restoration by Ferrari in Maranello. One of just 16 in existence, it has a 3-litre V12 engine which develops around 280bhp. It will do 0-60mph in less than 7 seconds and hit a top speed of more than 150mph. It will be sold next month at RM Sotheby's auction in Villa Erba, Italy, and has a guide price of around £8 million.

It will do 0-60mph in less than 7 seconds and hit a top speed of more than 150mph and in the auction catalogue, RM Sotheby's called it 'the most celebrated open-air Ferrari ever made' and 'an automobile with few peers' But it is expected to sell for significantly more after a model previously owned by the French actor Alain Delon and requiring a full restoration sold for £12.5 million earlier this year. Peter Wallman, car specialist at RM Sotheby's, said: 'Perhaps the most beautiful convertible car ever made, and featuring the powerful Colombo designed 3.0-litre V12 engine, this spacious and versatile two-seat sports car with race car performance is the ultimate road going Ferrari of all time.' The car's ability to be driven at high speed on the track as well as comfortably across continents boosted appeal to a number of high profile customers. Hollywood star James Coburn owned one - with Chris Evans buying it in 2008 for a then world record £5.6 million. The Delon car sold for more than twice this figure seven years later.

75,35d559779b0b9849bd394864a13c14eaa845f877,"A robot has been 'arrested' by Swiss police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the 'dark net'. The automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to $100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web. The robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of St Gallen, in north east Switzerland. The Random Darknet Shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web (pictured) including trainers, jeans, cigarettes, a set of masterkeys and a DVD case (far left) containing 10 ecstasy tablets . The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers, counterfeit designer jeans, the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However, it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets, which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines, which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins, the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs, hacked information, credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs, the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased. Tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class-A drug MDMA, which the police then destroyed. The computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot, !Mediengruppe Bitnik, along with the other items it bought. They described the police's actions as an 'unjustified intervention into the freedom of art'. Writing on their blog, London based artists Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo, who were behind the project, said: 'Random Darknet Shopper has finally been released and is now back in our possession. 'At the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution. 'In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of Ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition. 'The public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work Random Darknet Shopper justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts, even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited. 'We as well as the Random Darknet Shopper have been cleared of all charges. This is a great day for the bot, for us and for freedom of art!' The Random Darknet Shopper project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use. It used Bitcoin to randomly purchase items that were offered for sail in the darknet. The tablets, pictured above, were sent from Germany inside a DVD case and a vacuum sealed foil bag . They were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the Kunst Halle in St Gallen. During the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake Louis Vuitton handbag, a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 Chesterfield cigarettes. The darknet market features more than 16,000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous. The ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of MDMA and were destroyed by the Swiss authorities . It has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography, drugs and weapons. The robot software bought the ecstasy in October. It was sent from Germany to Switzerland and apparently crossed the border hidden in a DVD case without being intercepted by the authorities. The drugs were allowed to remain on show in the exhibition until it ended in January. However, the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties. Speaking to the Guardian, Mr Smoljo said that they had been told although the computer had purchased the drugs itself, they were the legal owners of the drugs as they had executed the code behind the software. The case has raised important questions about the use of automatic shopping bots and the use of the darknet. In the past the artists have used technology to intercept CCTV images and sent a package to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Mr Smoljo and Miss Weisskopf said: 'The Random Darknet Shopper is a live Mail Art piece, an exploration of the deep web via the goods traded there.'","Random Darknet Shopper is a computer bot that randomly purchases an item every week from a hidden part of the internet called the dark net .

76,b91e6223fb91f7a29fcc925a7a04ef72075eaab2,"Britain's five highest-earning NHS dentists are paid average salaries of £690,000 a year. The sum is almost five times the Prime Minister’s £142,500 pay packet – and comes as thousands of patients struggle to get on the books of NHS practices. A further 11 dentists were paid between £400,000 and £500,000 and a total of 177 received more than £200,000. More than 1,600 pocketed £100,000-£200,000. The figures lay bare the huge amounts of taxpayers’ money paid to dentists for NHS work, following Labour’s introduction of controversial contracts in 2006. Scroll down for video . Lucrative: Some dentists earn from multiple NHS contracts, as well as private patients . Campaigners said the payments were ‘scandalous’ and ‘unacceptable’. Under freedom of information laws, the NHS Business Services Authority was asked about the pensionable pay of dentists who do NHS work. In 2012/13, the latest figures available, five practitioners were paid more than £500,000. They shared a total of about £3.4million – an average of £690,000. This comes on top of any money they take from treating patients privately. Another 11 earned £400,000 to £499,999 from the NHS, 30 received £300,000 to £399,999, 131 pocketed £200,000 to £299,999 and 1,617 received £100,000 to £199,999. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the rates of pay were ‘exorbitant’. Yesterday's Daily Mail . She added: ‘Investment is urgently needed on the front line where there is a desperate shortage of nurses [and] patients waiting for hours in A&E … when the NHS is under such huge financial pressure, this type of spending on huge salaries is unacceptable.’ It follows revelations in Thursday’s Mail that millions of pounds was being wasted on NHS prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Yesterday, the Mail also exposed a £2,700 charge for cataract surgery at some hospitals – treble the cost to the health service – raising suspicions that patients are being ripped off. Patient Concern’s Roger Goss said: ‘This is scandalous. People will be shocked to hear the sums lining dentists’ pockets when it is almost impossible to find dental care on the NHS in some parts of the country. ‘There is something strange going on when the NHS will pay for gastric bands, suncream and hangover tablets yet it is so difficult to get dental treatment on it. It is almost perverse.’ Jonathan Isaby of the Taxpayers Alliance, which the Mail commissioned to carry out the research, said the salaries show a ‘shameless public sector elite taking taxpayers for a ride’. He added: ‘It is outrageous that these telephone-number salaries have been hidden from the people who pay them … Taxpayers expect the money they put in to the NHS to be spent on patients, not on bumper pay packets.’ The contracts brought in by Labour were designed to improve access to NHS dentistry. But patients are still struggling to get an appointment. The pay deals gave practitioners a fixed sum for a set amount of work agreed at the start of the year, rather than separate incomes for the number of patients treated or procedures done. Thursday's Daily Mail . Treatments are divided into three bands, from a simple check-up earning the dentist £25, to procedures such as fitting dentures and crowns, for roughly £300. The value of a contract can run to millions of pounds, and some dentists run more than one practice so hold multiple contracts. According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre, 21,500 dentists did NHS work in 2012/13, but most also do substantial amounts of private work. The British Dental Association’s Mick Armstrong said the top-earning dentists ‘most likely own a group of practices’ or are specialists in their area. But Tory Charlotte Leslie, who sat on the health select committee of MPs, said: ‘Most people will be absolutely stunned individual clinicians are getting such astronomical salaries on the NHS.’ A spokesman for NHS England said it contracts the vast majority of dental services from self-employed individuals or companies, some of whom ‘earn income from a number of contracts’.","Highest-earning NHS dentists earn almost five times more than Prime Minister’s £142,500 pay packet .

77,91b802bf26bef2ab42a5f02b4beab497f690a8f8,"Voters are still 'in the dark' about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day, economic experts warned today. Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given 'anything like full details' on how they will tackle the nations' debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving 'no detail' about their deficit reduction plan, which relies on £30billion of cuts, while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra £26billion-a-year. Scroll down for video . The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on 'almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases'. The think-tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May's General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. 'Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. 'But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. 'While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition, its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year.' Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly £3 billion. Borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was £87.3 billion for the year to the end of March, down from £98.5 billion in 2013/14, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The result undershot the latest target of £90.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the time of last month's Budget. It means that annual borrowing (GDP) has fallen by more than £60 billion from £153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, underlying debt of £1.48 trillion is more than £500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of £956 billion. The nation's debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP, up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya Keynes said: 'The Conservatives have said they want to eliminate the deficit but provided next to no detail on how they would do it. 'They should be forthcoming on the £5 billion of largely unspecified clampdown on tax avoidance, the £10 billion of unspecified cuts to social security spending and, according to our calculations, further real cuts to unprotected departments of around £30 billion.' Turning to Labour, the IFS said the Opposition had been 'considerably more vague' about how much it wants to borrow. The pledge to produce a surplus but without specifying by when or how much could be consistent with a reduction in borrowing totalling 3.6 per cent of national income. Senior research economist Rowena Crawford said: 'Labour's proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest. 'But this would leave borrowing at £26billion a year in today's terms. 'If Labour wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there.' The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017-18, revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. The SNP's figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as Labour, the IFS said, although the reduction would be slower. This means the SNP is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity, the think-tank said. The independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy, with Labour accusing the Tories of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world's advanced economies and the Conservatives renewing warnings that Britain's economy would suffer from an 'SNP/Miliband nightmare'. Labour's Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party, with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years. 'The Tories might be able to make the cuts but the last five years show they will fail to cut the deficit as they claim. They have borrowed £200 billion more than they planned because their failure to boost living standards has led to tax revenues falling short.' But Mr Osborne today warned that every family in the country will be left £350 worse off if the SNP is left calling the shots in a Labour government. The Chancellor warned of a 'dangerous cocktail' if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. With polls showing no party will win an overall majority, Mr Osborne claimed it would spark a 'constitutional crisis' if Scottish nationalist MPs held the balance of power in the UK government. Launching the SNP manifesto this week, Ms Sturgeon named her price for supporting Labour in any post-election deal. She demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK, raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. And she unveiled a £140billion 'ransom note' for Britain to drag Labour to the left, including an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. Mr Osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that Treasury analysis suggests it would add £6billion to Britain's interest bill, worth £350 per family. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's a new feature of this election that a Labour party cannot win an overall majority, so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of Scottish Nationalists. 'We've got a strong plan for a national recovery, but it's perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what Gordon Brown described last night as 'constitutional chaos'. 'The Scottish Nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a Labour minority government propped up by them.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The politicians seeking our votes owe it to taxpayers to come clean about what spending the country can, and cannot, afford. 'This candour has so far been noticeably absent in the election campaign, with politicians failing to acknowledge the dire state of the public finances and instead clambering over each other to make additional and apparently unfunded spending pledges.'

The long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer, it's the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit. But what trainers should you go for? Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you don't have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly - proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for £130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out £130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi's budget £19.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast, supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow (Thursday) with trainers available for the budget price of £19.99, while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience - so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand? FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow, a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co-writer of Nell McAndrew's Guide To Running, to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost, £130: Adidas promise to deliver 'your greatest run ever' with their new trainer which features their much-hyped 'Boost' technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives 'energy return' so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver 'your greatest run ever' while the Primeknit fabric is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape' At £130, the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole doesn't seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes, including Jessica Ennis, who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2:03:23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version, which have been on sale since February at a RRP of £130, adidas executive Eric Liedtke said: 'Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. 'All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return, alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort.' Aldi Premium Running Shoes, £19.99: The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi's latest 'Specialbuys' running range under the label 'Crane', which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It's not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non 'premium' version went on sale for £14.99 in 2013. Aldi's £19.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men's version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is 'high spec' despite the low prices, as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands, having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain aren't in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can't lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY'S VERDICT: APPEARANCE . Adidas: The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape.' The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they don't make your feet look small and dainty. But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers, they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi: The supermarket's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends didn't guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it doesn't look like it will have much give when running. LUCY'S VERDICT: FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas: The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the Primeknit fabric makes it feel you're putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small, so it's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so, I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they didn't pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running, and they weren't too lose at the heel so they didn't rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn't the case, even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance, the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers, left, fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run, while the Aldi trainers, right, were adequate but felt bulkier and weren't as snug a fit . Aldi: The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size, despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However, they didn't rub so I again didn't suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and weren't as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall, they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I didn't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY'S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise, the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part - although the fit wasn't ideal. I'd recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out, who may just be running two or three times a week and aren't sure yet if they'll stick with it. At £19.99, if you don't carry on running if your motivation wanes, you won't be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However, if you intend to carry on running, I'd recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork, they're great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I'm not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the £130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I'm also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable - after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts.","Running is often celebrated as a cheap sport to take up .

79,7638ccd8fff2a7a5c0541faf3b52dbb443845e49,"An apprentice electrician fell off a ladder and died in front of his father after he was electrocuted while testing lights in a factory, an inquest has heard. Nathan Brown, 19, was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, when he apparently touched a set of exposed electrical bars powering a crane. The shock caused him to fall 12ft head first onto the roof of a toilet block below the crane. He was airlifted to hospital but later died from his injuries. Tragic: Apprentice electrician Nathan Brown died after being electrocuted while testing lights . Accident: Nathan fell 12ft from a ladder after being electrocuted, and later died of his injuries . The inquest in Oldham heard that Nathan - described by his family as a 'cheeky, happy boy' - trained to become an electrician so he could follow in his father's footsteps. The pair were both working at Eurofabs UK Ltd, a sheet metal manufacturer in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, when tragedy struck in September 2013. Nathan was told to climb up a ladder onto the walkway of a crane and test the lights in the building's roof, taking readings and shouting them down to his father - a task as easy as plugging in a television. But he accidentally touched a 400-volt busbar, a metal strip which conducts electricity within a switchboard, while he was trying to climb high enough to carry out the tests. Forensic pathologist Philip Lumb told the inquest he found burn marks consistent with electrocution on Nathan's arm. Family: The 19-year-old was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, at the time of his death . He said: 'I gather Nathan was an apprentice electrician who was working for his father and contracted by a company called Eurofabs to conduct a complete electrical inspection. 'One of his duties was to inspect one part of the roof. In order to gain access, Nathan had to get on top of a toilet block and place a ladder against an electrical crane to access the platform where the lights were located. 'His father was working in the premises at the time. A short time late his father saw Nathan fall head first into the roof of the toilet block, about 12ft. He did not note any sounds of attempts to break his fall. 'He went to attend to him but found him in a collapsed condition, although his father said he may be able to feel a pulse.' Dr Lumb told the inquest the cause of Nathan's death was electrocution and that he probably suffered cardiac arrest before falling to the ground. His mother Nicole, 47, said she learnt of the accident when she was called by her other son Gary, who worked at Eurofabs. She told the inquest: 'He said, ""Don't panic mum but Nathan has had a fall."" I remember saying, ""Why, what happened?"" He said, ""He has fallen from a ladder."" 'I asked if he was OK and he said he didn't know as he wasn't conscious. He said, ""You need to get here as soon as you can mum."" I just rushed out the house and got on the car and drove straight over. 'I remember running up the stairs to get to him. I just got more or less up the stairs and I saw the paramedics trying to save him.' Workplace: Nathan and his father were carrying out electrical tests at Eurofabs UK in Rochdale . In a statement Mr Brown, 50, who has been an electrician for 32 years, said that his son had joined him as an apprentice in September 2012 after embarking on a three-year training course, and had completed health and safety training a month before the fatal accident. He said: 'As an apprentice he was learning on the job and only ever allowed to complete basic tasks such as basic electrics, switches, sockets and lights. 'You would only ever allow Nathan to carry out work when safe for him to do so and work within capability, knowledge and competence.' Mr Brown said he had carried out work at the Eurofabs premises twice before, and on this occasion was carrying out a general electrical survey which he likened to an 'MOT.' He said he decided to put a ladder over the toilet block beneath a 10-tonne travelling crane and had not seen the busbar overhead. He told the inquest: 'As far as I am aware the busbar should have been marked up in a sleeve with the marking ""danger high voltage"". I have never come across a busbar not sleeved and marked with an appropriate sign. 'Had I been aware of the presence of the busbars in such unprotected conditions then I would not have continued to take this work. In all 32 years' experience with busbars I have seen them properly protected and never come across exposed busbars as present on the day of the accident. 'That was the worst and fastest day of my life. It's a blur but I can't get rid of some of those thoughts. The test he was doing would be as simple as plugging a TV into a wall. 'I'm completely devastated by the accident and life will never be the same again. He was the light of my life and my family and I will miss him so much. Time is a great healer and I hope that will be the case.' The inquest continues.","Nathan Brown, 19, was working with father David testing lights in a factory .

FA chairman Dyke must find £30million to fund his masterplan to reform grassroots football with more 3G pitches in urban coaching hubs, and has identified the non-league national team as an area of potential saving. England C, which has operated under different names since it was formed in 1979, is managed by former Barnet boss Paul Fairclough, who selects from players outside the Football League, aged 23 and under. FA chairman Greg Dyke could axe the England C team to save money to help improve grassroots football . The team normally plays only three or four times a season, but some friendly fixtures have attracted attention inside the organisation because of the elaborate travel involved. England won 6-1 in Bermuda, in June 2013, and won 1-0 in Jordan, in March last year. Fairclough’s team also compete in the International Challenge Trophy, a competition for European semi-pro national teams, but did not qualify for the semi-finals of this year’s tournament from a home-and-away qualifying group featuring Turkey, Slovakia and Estonia. They were beaten by Cyprus U21s in friendly in Larnaca, in February, but there are no more fixtures planned and, since a meeting last week, fears have increased about the long-term future for a team which has been known since its formation as the National Game XI, England Semi-Pro and England Non-League. Paul Fairclough (left) is the current manager of the team and he selects non-league players under 23 . Those capped at this level include George Boyd of Burnley, Craig Mackail-Smith of Brighton and Steve Morison of Leeds, who all went on to play at full international level, although not for England. Boyd and Mackail-Smith won caps for Scotland and Morison for Wales. Former Leicester winger Steve Guppy won one senior England cap after playing once for his country at non-league level. Guppy also won one cap for the U21s and one for England B, which could make him the ultimate one-cap wonder. Barnsley manager Lee Johnson was also capped at non-league level.

But the pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority. Different polls have variously put the Tories and Labour narrowly ahead, with David Cameron and Ed Miliband both facing the prospect of having to rely on smaller parties to form a government. The pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority . Experts have warned of the impact on the economy of a badly hung parliament, with neither major party able to form a stable government. There are fears it could sent pound plummeting by another 10 per cent. Today’s fall in the value of the pound was also impacted by figures showing industrial production grew by just 0.1 per cent in February. Construction shrank by 0.9 per cent following a 2.5 per cent contraction in January. It was suggested that the figures pointed to overall growth slowing to 0.4 per cent for the first quarter, down from 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2014. That would be the weakest pace of growth since the end of 2013. Labour have made gains in a series of opinion polls, enjoying leads in three and cutting the Conservative lead in another. The latest survey also contains good news for the Liberal Democrats who gain three points to draw level with Ukip for the first time in more than 18 months. Based on the 2010 election result, David Cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the Commons, while Ed Miliband needs at least  70. Nick Clegg is defending 56 seats, but is braced for heavy losses . ComRes research for ITV and the Daily Mail suggested the race was still too tight to call with the Tories on 34 per cent and Labour on 33 per cent, but that compared with a four-point deficit for Ed Miliband's Opposition at the start of the campaign. Other polls gave Labour leads of between three and six points and one suggested that for the first time voters thought Ed Miliband was doing a better job than David Cameron. The Opposition gained two points on last week in the Survation poll for the Mirror, while the Conservatives dipped one, to move ahead by 35 per cent to 31 per cent. The Labour leader - despite still trailing his Tory rival as the best to be prime minister by 37 per cent to 25 per cent - will be delighted at their latest personal approval ratings after lagging consistently behind throughout most of his leadership. A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said last week that ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’ s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.’ BlackRock, which invests in major British companies such as Tesco, said weeks of horse-trading to form a government would be ‘harrowing for the UK’.","Pound near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 .

Pictured: NSW police busted an illegal firearm operation in the Casino and Lismore areas last month . Both suburbs saw an increase of almost 500 guns in their areas over the last five years. Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki (pictured) said US's popular national gun laws and pop culture was likely to be driving the increase . Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki said the United State's popular national gun laws, and the country's influence on Australia through popular culture, was likely to be driving the increase in licence holders in the state. 'There is an element in the community who are swayed by the US culture that guns are a right rather than a privilege,' Supt Plotecki told News Corp. 'Generally speaking however Australians don't have a strong gun culture and recent strong reaction against relaxing our gun ownership laws is indicative of this - Australians don't want lax gun laws'. He added that there did not appear to have been an increase in gun related crime that related to the increase in licences. Although the figures revealed that each person with a licence owns an average of 2.3 guns each, the Firearm Registry's regulations suggest it's not easy to acquire a licence. Each request must include a 'genuine reason', proved through supporting evidence, with each reason in turn holding restrictions on the type of gun that can be owned. Sport, recreational hunting, rural occupation, firearms collection and animal welfare are all listed as 'genuine reasons'.

The 23-year-old was reported missing the following day when he failed to return to his hotel in Fort William. When he vanished people were being urged not to go to Scotland's mountains unless they had the proper equipment and experience due to the severe weather conditions. The mercury had plunged to minus seven and winds of up to 70mph were recorded in the region. There was also snow on the mountain's peak. It was believed Kyle, who was not an experienced walker, had attempted to climb the Ben Nevis alone. When he set off on the climb Kyle was wearing dark waterproof trousers, walking boots and a jacket with red flashes on it. Searches of Ben Nevis and the Glen Nevis area of Lochaber were launched after the alarm was raised, with Lochaber Mountain Rescue and a RAF search and rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth being scrambled to the scene. Search and rescue dogs also joined in the hunt for missing Kyle. Rescuers were forced to call off the hunt due to band weather in the Scottish Highlands. Today, a body was recovered by a Royal Navy Helicopter in the Surgeon's Gully area, to the south east of Ben Nevis. It has been identified as that of Mr Knox and his family have been informed. It was believed that Mr Knox, 23, of London, was attempting to scale the 4409-ft high peak alone .","Kyle Knox, 23, disappeared as he tried to climb 4409-ft high Ben Nevis .

Luke has been missing for two nights in a Victorian national park, with temperatures dropping to as low as eight degree Celsius on Saturday night. However, he may not even know he is lost and is known to frequently hide, according to his family. He was last seen leaving Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park near Lake Eildon at 9.30am on Good Friday. According the Herald Sun, the 11-year-old was reportedly seen walking near the Devils River on Sunday, four kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen. Search crews have rushed to the location and police remain comfortable that the young boy is still alive. Luke has limited speech and his family says he is probably confused, and he may not even be aware he is lost. Campers are helping rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES volunteers in the search of thick bushland. Scroll down for video . Luke Shambrook was last seen on the national park at 9.30am on Good Friday. It is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since . Police assume Luke has spent 36 hours without food or water and on Saturday night would have experienced temperatures as low as 8 degree Celsius. Police hold hope that Luke has been able to stay reasonably warm as he was last seen wearing a beanie and warm jacket. There was a moment of hope when a beanie was found by the search party, however it was decided it did not belong to Luke. Having met Luke's family during a push to open a special school in Melbourne's southeast, Opposition emergency services spokeman Brad Battin says it's devastating to hear the 11-year-old is missing. He says Luke's parents Tim and Rachel have been updating him on the search and appreciate the efforts of all those out looking for their little boy. 'He's a lovely young kid,' Mr Battin told AAP on Sunday. 'He displays all the characteristics of a child with autism, which means he might not even think he is lost.'

'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush, we've got a lot searchers searching all the tracks and in between the tracks and the gullies and the spurs,' he told reporters on Saturday. The Shambrook family has thanked emergency service workers, volunteers, family and friends for their help. They say the disappearance is completely out of character for him.

'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush,' he told reporters on Saturday. 'We've also got people walking the banks of the lake.' But he outlined a serious hurdle for the search efforts, according to ABC. 'With the autistic condition, Luke might not respond to searchers, he may not even know that he's lost,' he said. 'He won't necessarily respond to his name being called, but that might change a little bit as he gets hungry maybe.

The family of Lavall Hall, released the shocking video which calls into question the Miami Gardens police department's account of the incident on February 15. The clip captured from the police car at the scene shows shell cases flying as a police officer shot the 25-year-old schizophrenic, who was black, on February 15. The police department said the officers were forced to shoot because Hall 'attacked' them with 'deadly force' using the broom - but the video footage appears to show him trying to flee the officers before he was fatally shot. Footage captured from within a police car at the scene show shell cases flying as police officer Eddie Trimino fatally shot schizophrenic 25-year-old Lavall Hall, who was black, outside his home in Miami Gardens . Attorneys for Hall's family released the 19 minutes of dash-cam video yesterday afternoon at a press conference and claim it shows Hall was being chased by police before he was shot at five times. Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week earlier and was suffering from a psychotic episode when his mother, Catherine Daniels, called police to take him to a mental health unit, reports Fusion. Hall's family have now filed a wrongful death lawsuit  in federal court in Miami against the city of Miami Gardens and the two police officers, Peter Ehrlich and Eddo Trimino. According to the complaint Ms Daniels had previously called police for help with her son, and the department was aware of his condition, alleging excessive use of force by police and wrongful death. An officer can be heard shouting 'Get on the f****** ground or you're dead' on the police car footage . Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week before the shooting . The footage shot from inside the car appears to show Hall running past the car with two officers in pursuit . 'Hall was unable to communicate, clearly did not understand what was going on, and was visibly scared,' it said. Two of the five bullets fired hit Hall Miami Gardens police told reporters in the days after the incident - explaining that Hall had attacked officers with the broom. But Hall's lawyers argue that the police used 'excessive force' after he ran away from them. His lawyers said Hall was holding the broomstick and dressed only in his underpants but the video shows he can be seen running from the police. Ms Daniels said at a news conference yesterday: 'I never thought they [were] going to kill my child, murder my child,' adding she was 'devastated' when she first saw the video. Catherine Daniels, Lavall's mother, is hugged by her cousin Alfonzo Hill at the news conference yesterday . 'He was standing outside just holding the broomstick in his hand,' Daniels said. 'And I told him, 'Baby, come back inside, it's cold.' As the video played at the news conference, one of the attorneys for the family said Ms Daniels can be heard telling police before the shooting, 'Please don't hurt my child, please' ABC news reported. Her attorney added: 'The officers had made up their minds that they were going to kill Lavall before this incident took place.' 'They killed him, murdered him,' said Melissa Edwards, the mother of Hall's daughter, at the news conference. An attorney for Eddo Trimino, the officer involved, told the Miami Herald the video indicated that the officer had shot out of fear. The lawyer for the officers argues they acted appropriately and claims Hall attacked them with deadly force . The video was released amid national protests over a series of deaths resulting from police use of force, most recently with another video showing a white South Carolina police officer shooting an apparently unarmed black man in the back. 'People are saddened and angered but also exasperated that we're again seeing the devaluation of black lives on streets of the United States,' said Muhammed Malik, organizer of the Miami Committee on State Violence. A spokesman for Florida State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told ABC News that the investigation is ongoing but they have concerns the video may endanger the investigation. Oscar Marrero, attorney for the officers, told ABC News: 'The officers were faced with a dangerous situation. 'They have already given statements to investigators indicating Mr. Hall struck them with a weapon and deadly force was used. 'The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene. The reliable evidence will establish Officers Trimino and Ehrlich acted appropriately.'","Lavall Hall, 25, was suffering psychotic episode when fatally shot by police .

A study found youngsters were more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them were distracted – with texting or talking on the phone a common cause. Researchers observed randomly selected parents with children who looked between 18 months and five years old at playgrounds in New York. Children are more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them are distracted by texting or talking on the phone, the study showed (file picture) They measured factors such as the adult’s level of engagement with the child and how distracted they seemed. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first. Children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first and found children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way . Electronic devices such as mobile phones were responsible for 30 per cent of all parental distractions. Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt. Study author Ruth Milanaik, of Cohen Children’s Medical Centre in New York, called on gadget-obsessed parents to keep a closer eye on their offspring, saying: ‘Increased awareness of limiting electronic distractions and other activities that interfere with supervision should be considered.’ A neuroscientist claims that modern technology such as computer tablets and mobile phones could be changing the way our brains work . Professor Susan Greenfield warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget-filled, pharmaceutically-enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains, we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro-chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines, and between our bodies and the outside world. Electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be anging the way our brains work, according to a neuroscientist . She said: 'One vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine. 'It not only goes on developing, changing and, in some tragic cases, eventually deteriorating with age, it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. When I say ""shaped"", I'm not talking figuratively or metaphorically; I'm talking literally. At a microcellular level, the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences and stimuli.' The brain, in other words, is malleable - not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood, and, in certain instances, beyond. The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind. Of course, there's nothing new about that: human brains have been changing, adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries. But in the last century, development of new technologies has increased dramatically. 'This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined,' she said. 'Our brains are under the influence of an ever- expanding world of new technology: multichannel television, video games, MP3 players, the internet, wireless networks, Bluetooth links - the list goes on and on. 'This games-driven generation interpret the world through screen-shaped eyes. It's almost as if something hasn't really happened until it's been posted on Facebook, Bebo or YouTube. 'We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer-generated moment, and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world.' 'Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro- cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains. And that, in turn, affects our personality, our behaviour and our characteristics. In short, the modern world could well be altering our human identity.'","Researchers observed random parents with children at NY playgrounds .

90,cdf27c4ae412a4b9b5841d2e31d4d8c8314c80ee,"Nine council workers have been sacked for inappropriately accessing confidential social work files on tragic toddler Mikaeel Kular. The three-year-old was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya, who beat him for being sick and left him to die in agony for three days before hiding his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods. She then told police the boy had wandered off, sparking a huge manhunt before eventually leading officers to the body near Kirkcaldy in Fife, in January last year. Scroll down for video . Victim: Fife council workers looked at Mikaeel Kular's (left) confidential files after he was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya (right) Police Scotland probed the claims and an internal investigation was launched by Fife Council last year when up to 25 staff were alleged to have accessed confidential social work files belonging to the youngster. It has now been revealed at least nine workers were subject to disciplinary action and subsequently dismissed after looking at documents relating to the high-profile case without permission. Adekoya, who had frequently left her children home alone to go to nightclubs and take cocaine, was jailed for 11 years in August last year but could be free within seven. She repeatedly beat her son before putting his lifeless body in a suitcase and leaving it in woodland behind her sister's home. Investigations found her internet history included searches 'I find it hard to love my son', 'I love all of my children except one', 'why am I so aggressive with my son' and 'get rid of bruises'. Five thousand local residents signed a petition protesting against the failure of prosecutors to pursue a murder charge against her. Social services were also widely criticised for failing Mikaeel after it emerged he was twice taken into care by social workers. At the time of the trial, the court was told how Fife social services monitored Adekoya and her young family until December 2013 – the month before Mikaeel's death. Tragic: Scores of tributes were left near to the youngster's home in Edinburgh following a massive search to find him . Grim discovery: The three-year-old's body was found in woodland behind his auntie's house in Fife . However, Adekoya was not on the radar of social workers in Edinburgh, despite having moved to the Scottish capital. Craig Munro, Executive Director of Education and Children's Services at Fife council said: . 'We have a clear internal process for dealing with discipline issues and we don't comment publicly on the individual circumstances of staff.' A seperate investigation into whether Mikaeel's death could have been prevented is due to be published in a matter of weeks. Police Scotland said they would not be taking the matter further. A spokesman said: 'No criminal complaint had been made so we consider it an internal matter for Fife Council.'","Fife Council launched internal investigation following accusations .

91,57bad62c610754c019aaceed38930ba07cdf1656,"Rape: Edwin 'Jock' Mee is accused of attacking several Army cadets while working as a recruitment sergeant . An Army recruiting sergeant raped a teenage cadet after telling her he could help her get a visa from the Home Office, a court heard today. Edwin 'Jock' Mee allegedly told the 18-year-old, from Sierra Leone, that her visa application had been delayed in order to persuade her to have sex with him. He is accused of carrying out sex attacks on 11 victims as young as 15 while working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, between October 2010 and September 2011. One woman told Southwark Crown Court today that she saw Mee, 46, as a father figure after he helped her join the Army. She said: 'He was like someone I could really lean on because, going for some interviews with him, he would ask me everything about my personal life, everything, because he said that is the procedure they need to do. 'So it is like I took him as a father, or someone I can relate to, or maybe understand what is happening to me.' Jurors heard that Mee repeatedly asked the teenager if she wanted to have sex with him - she initially ignored him, but later explicitly told him she did not want to do. The court heard that one occasion when she went to see Mee, he slapped her bottom as she left the office, and she told him 'never do that'. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC asked the woman why she did not tell any of the other recruiters what was going on. The witness replied: 'He always told me not to say anything to anyone because no one will believe me and looking at him, and his status, all these things, I believed him.' Describing the alleged rape, the woman said she had gone in for her final Army selection interview in August 2011 before the conclusion of the process. Around the same time she was trying to renew her visa with the Home Office, and was not aware of any problems with the application before she went to see Mee. She said: 'He said there was a delay for me to pay the money, that if the visa didn't come, I can't go for selection and my date was already fixed. He told me he can help me. 'He told me that because I need to go to selection and my passport was with the Home Office, and he told me that he was going to help and I said, ""How are you going to do that?"" He just said, ""A call that I can make,"" and I said ""Why don't you do it?"" 'He said: ""You know what you can do that will make me do it.""' Base: Mee was working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, pictured . The court heard that Mee then told the woman to wait for the 'boss' who was going to conduct her interview. But he returned a short time later, told her that he would now be talking to her and took her to the kitchen area, jurors were told. Dressed in his Army uniform, Mee allegedly spoke to the woman about her selection procedure and the fact her passport was with the Home Office, before leaving her waiting alone again. The woman said: 'He came back and sat, he started asking me if I was going to have sex with him.' Jurors heard that she told Mee 'no' and that she was simply there to see the 'boss', still believing that there were other people in the recruitment office. When he asked her for sex again he allegedly said that no one would ever know, and later revealed that there was nobody left in the office. The woman told the court that Mee then 'jumped' and kissed her on the lips, before asking her to lift up her skirt and show him her underwear. He then pounced on the woman and began assaulting her, before she told him that she could not breathe. 'I was suffocating because he was on top of me,' the woman said. 'And I told him that I was suffocating, he got scared a bit and that is when he jumped off me, because I wasn't breathing.' After the incident Mee drove the woman home, telling her not to tell anyone what had happened, and said that he was helping her out, the court heard. The woman said she kept quiet about what happened because he was 'a big person in the Army' and she did not think anyone would believe her. Jurors heard that soon afterwards, the alleged victim received a letter from the Home Office saying her visa had been granted, and she thought Mee had been responsible for this. Sergeant: Mee denies assaulting the women between 2010 and 2011 . Mee, who now lives in Scotland, denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three rapes and one count of assault by penetration. Jurors also heard that the woman kept a diary in which she wrote entries about her daily life. Writing about the day she was allegedly raped, she said: 'Jock also got a message from the Home Office that they are not going to grant me the extension because I was late to pay the money. 'Jock had to beg for me and he also sent them a letter to appeal on my behalf. I am so thankful to God that Jock helped me out in that. He has always been there for me, if they don't agree he said he will marry me. LOL. 'That is so sweet of him. God, please don't let anything happen to me.' In cross-examination Lisa Wilding QC asked the woman if Mee had offered to marry her 'jokingly or seriously'. 'That is why I put LOL because that is what I thought, because he is telling me all these things that I wasn't aware of,' she replied. In another entry a few days later, she thanked the sergeant for helping her with her application to remain in the UK. She wrote: 'I also thank Jock for making that call to the Home Office. He helped me a lot. If he didn't call, they should have refused me.' Asked why she hadn't told anyone of the rape, the woman explained that she was like an abused child. She said: 'He is just like a father who is abusing a child and the child doesn't know that you are abusing it, and you are torn between love and hate. That is how I felt.' The trial continues.

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction.

95,64ee7c9eb9f1efbb7da0ce80498434c623615b84,"As Zlatan Ibrahimovic famously believes the World Cup is 'nothing to watch' without him, he's unlikely to be quaking in his boots about facing Lionel Messi in the Nou Camp on Tuesday night. For most people, Barcelona's progress into the Champions League semi-final looks a formality given they beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 in the first leg in France. The only man bound to disagree is the one who modestly called his autobiography 'I am Zlatan'. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is put through his paces with Blaise Matuidi (left) and Zoumana Camara at the Nou Camp . Ibrahimovic and his PSG team-mates, including David Luiz, pictured, face Barcelona on Tuesday night . The Sweden international was suspended for the first leg after he was dismissed against Chelsea . At 33, Ibrahimovic is past caring what other people think of him. With an ego that makes Louis van Gaal look like a shrinking violet, he'll walk down the tunnel at the Nou Camp convinced in his own mind that Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez will be in awe of him. When asked to name a dream team of team-mates he'd played with, he named himself up front with Messi – ahead of Thierry Henry and Alessandro del Piero. 'Football isn't something you plan in advance. It just happens,' he says. His 30-yard propellor kick for Sweden against England is rated by Steven Gerrard as the greatest goal he's ever seen. To be fair, Ibrahimovic's CV allows him plenty of bragging rights. The Swede with Bosnian roots has played for Ajax, Juventus, Barcelona and both Milan giants. He once won eight league titles in a row. Not bad for a poor kid whose immigrant parents moved to the roughest part of Malmo. Now he's trying to make new history with PSG. He was the marquee signing when Qatari owners bought the Paris side and decided to try and turn it into Europe's greatest football club. They agreed to pay him £200,000-a-week, even though France's 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to £50million a year. Not that Ibrahimovic is that overly grateful. He recently called France a 's**t country' and had to apologise in a rare burst of self-awareness. Despite domestic dominance, Champions League glory has remained elusive so far. Ibrahimovic has never won the trophy as a player, and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against Chelsea and was therefore suspended for the first leg against Barca. Ibrahimovic is PSG's main attraction and will take centre stage against his old club Barcelona on Tuesday . The former Barcelona striker jumps for joy after scoirng against Bastia in the French League Cup final . Ibrahimovic, pictured celebrating with Marquinhos, will be convinced that PSG can progress against Barca . For Paris to pull off one of European football's greatest comebacks, Zlatan and Marco Verratti will have to excel. Ibrahimovic undoubtedly has the talent to produce a flash of brilliance or two to put Luis Enrique's men under pressure. His balletic left-footed back heel while on the rise for Sweden against Italy at Euro 2004 was a goal very few players could have scored. His famous strike against England silenced those who wondered why he could never produce against British clubs. Against Barcelona, Ibra will have special motivation. He spent a season at the Nou Camp in 2009/10. It should have been the perfect stage for his talents but he moved to Inter Milan after just a year. Ibrahimovic spent just one season at the Nou Camp before moving to Serie A giants Inter Milan . He felt Messi's insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach Pep Guardiola wasn't strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them. He called Guardiola a 'spineless coward' after Barcelona were beaten by Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League. Ibrahimovic made his point by scoring for Paris in Barcelona in a group game earlier this season. But this is the big one. Nobody will give him a chance – except for Zlatan himself.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic will line up against former club Barcelona on Tuesday .

96,5cf4682cd03238d5867027ce9492b626cd1ed011,"Jameela spent £3,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. 'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. 'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally, I would even faint. There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible.' After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child. So she spent £3,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors. Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. 'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser. Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings aren't the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people. However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet. She's allergic to peanuts, shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten, found in wheat, barley and rye. Following blood tests, it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. 'All I could think of was I had to get rid of them,' says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed, they continued to affect her over the next few years. 'I hated the fatigue, the headaches, the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time,' Jameela says. 'I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. 'I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system.' Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they're concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. 'Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth,' he says. The number of fillings in the average adult's mouth . Still struggling, Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill. 'For my 25th birthday, my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question,' she says. 'It took about a year before I started to feel better. It's all had a massive impact on my life.' However, Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London, is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. 'You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected,' he says. 'Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. 'In fact, I see patients whose gut symptoms, ironically, seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems, when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders.' But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. 'There is so much we don't know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now,' she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic's laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation (CPA) to ensure that the tests are carried out properly.

97,3815d19af18ff22be6ad6095722d7367bb7271af,"A paramedic who pretended he was gay to get close to women before sexually assaulting them has been struck off the medical register. Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges . 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.' When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'","Christopher Bridger, 25, attacked three women after drinking sessions .

'Game Ready', as seen being used by Thiago Silva, is a cold therapy compression system used to treat sports injuries. It circulates cold water around the injury, cooling it down with the aim to bring players back from injury as soon as possible. He posted an update on Instagram, writing: 'Guys, I'm here to thank you all for your prayers!

PSG coach Laurent Blanc said on Friday: 'Thiago Silva is out for Nice even if his injury is not as bad as first feared.' The game against Nice comes more than 24 hours before league leaders Lyon face a tough task at home against fifth-place St Etienne. A win in south east France would put the French champions a point clear of their closest rivals. Lyon could take back top spot on Sunday but Blanc's side will have a game in hand at the close of the weekend. 'It is not easy to prepare for this match,' Blanc said. 'We must turn in up in championship mode. In this final stretch, we no longer have room for error.'

The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet. In February, the ""smart bullets"" -- .50-caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors -- passed their most successful round of live-fire tests to date, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the tests, an experienced marksman ""repeatedly hit moving and evading targets,"" a DARPA statement said. ""Additionally,"" the statement said, ""a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target."" In other words, now you don't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. ""True to DARPA's mission, EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible: the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target,"" said Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager. ""This live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO's guidance capabilities into a small .50-caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers,"" Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said.",".50-caliber bullets equipped with optical sensors can follow moving targets .

Kim Callaghan, 39, piled on the pounds after the birth of her two children, reaching a worrying  20st 3lb. However, the determined slimmer has now shrunk down to a slender 9st 10lb after taking up exercise and swapping starchy meals for smaller portions. Kim Callaghan became so worried that her weight was causing her to look like a man that she went on a dramatic diet that saw her lose half of her body weight . Kim's weight loss saw her drop an incredible ten dress sizes to slim down to a slinky size eight. Before she slimmed down Kim's wardrobe was limited to size 28 figure-hiding garments, and she was afraid she was losing her femininity. Kim who lives in Ardee, County Louth, Ireland, says she turned to masculine clothing as a way of hiding her shape. 'I only wore baggy trousers and flappy shirts when I was fat - I was trying to cover up my body because I was embarrassed. I stopped looking like a woman. 'Now I've slimmed down and I feel confident enough to wear dresses again. I feel healthy and very feminine.' Kim married her husband Sean Callaghan, 41, in 1999. After the pair got married they splashed out on a double deep-fat fryer. Kim piled on the pounds after giving birth to her two children, as she became heavier she worried that her husband Sean would not see her as the 'sexy' woman he married . Before her weight loss Kim was limited to a wardrobe of size 28 clothing she is now a slinky size 10 . The housewife's diet consisted mainly of convenience foods like chicken kiev, deep-fried chicken, potato croquettes and burgers. She said: 'We loved pizza, chips and chicken kievs. The deep fat fryer was my favourite thing in the house.' Soon after Kim gave birth to her children Owen, now 14, and Shannon, 13, and her weight gain accelerated. Eventually she tipped the scales at 20st 3lb and says that she found it increasingly difficult to find clothes to suit her. The turning point came for Kim when she struggled to keep up with her children she now takes part in regular exercise including cycling around her local area . Kim joined Slimming World in secret and lost a stone in her first three weeks . 'I tried to take pride in my appearance, but at that size it was impossible to find anything flattering, I ordered all my clothes from catalogues. 'Before long I had a wardrobe which could have been owned by a man. I had a signature cropped hairstyle and honestly looked nothing like a woman. I was worried that the the sexy, curvy bride which Sean had married had disappeared forever.' The turning point came for Kim when she was out with her children on St Patrick's Day in 2011. She had to stop and rest after struggling to keep up. She said: 'I was trying to follow the kids up a hill near our home. I was hot and sweaty and I had to stop to catch my breath. 'My weight was getting in the way of my life with my kids - I knew it was time to change. 'When I got home that night I found a Slimming World leaflet had been posted through my door. I thought it was a sign.' Kim started attending her local Slimming World classes in secret and was initially embarrassed to admit she was trying to lose weight. She said: 'It took all my courage to go to the meetings - I was convinced everyone would judge me. Kim feels far more feminine now that she is not limited to catalogue clothing . 'Three weeks later I'd shed a stone and I celebrated by telling my husband and the kids. They were all very supportive and amazed at what I had done.' In a bid to make a dramatic change she swapped greasy fried foods for healthy meals cooked from scratch. Kim even threw out her double deep-fat-fryer. The devoted slimmer also started running and cycling - and the pounds started to fall off. Soon she had slimmed down to the slinky 9st 10lb she is today and ditched her baggy unflattering clothes for good. She said: 'I love being able to go into shops and have everything fit me.

EasyJet and BA are among a host of major airlines expected to scrap hundreds of flights thanks to the walk-out, which will start at 5am tomorrow and run for 48 hours - with considerable knock-on disruption expected. Experts fear up to half of all flights between the UK and France could be axed, depending on how strongly the strike holds. Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Families returning from their Easter holidays and those hoping for a last-minute break will be worst affected. EasyJet is cancelling 118 flights to and from France, including 10 which either start or finish at British airports. A spokesman said: 'EasyJet has been advised of planned industrial strike action by French air traffic control services on April 8 and government transport workers on April 9. Like all airlines flying to and from France, we expect significant impact to our flights during this period, including cancellations.' The cancelled services include return flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Gatwick, Paris and Luton, Gatwick and Toulouse, plus flights between Gatwick and Spain. The airline urged all passengers going to France to check the status of their flight online before they travel. British Airways said it was cancelling around a dozen return flights from the UK. A  spokesman said: 'Early indications are that there will be significant disruption for all airlines who fly within, to and from France and who also use French airspace for over flights. 'We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers flying to and from France as a result of the threatened air traffic control strike. 'Unfortunately there will be some knock-on delays to other parts of our short-haul network as a result of the strike action, given how much airspace in Europe will be affected. We are sorry for any disruption to customers' travel plans.' Flybe said it was cancelling 16 flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Adding to the possible chaos, tomorrow is the first day of a new regultion which forces travel operators to check the passports of all passengers leaving Britain and pass on their details to the Home Office. Chaos: Charles de Gaulle Airport, pictured, and other French hubs will be severely affected by the strike . The strike has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe. The walk-out is one of a series planned this month, with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2. Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps. European air traffic chiefs at Eurocontrol have also warned of 'a significant risk of disruption', with the number of flights from France's busiest airport down 40 per cent tomorrow and 50 per cent on Thursday. National carrier Air France, based at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, is expected to be hardest hit. Air France said up to 40 per cent of its medium haul flights to and from Paris CDG will be cancelled. Rregional subsidiary HOP! will axe two thirds of its flights to and from Orly airport, and 40 per cent of services at other French airports. Britain's National Air Traffic Services, which controls the airspace over the UK, said: 'We've spoken to our operational teams and much will depend on the severity of the strike and how the airlines choose to respond in terms of their schedules. 'If it follows previous patterns we can expect a lot of airlines requesting to re-route around French airspace. That shifts the traffic from our usually very busy south coast airspace sectors to the west (Lands End) and east (Clacton and Dover).' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation as strike action is classed as an 'unforeseen circumstance' outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. Ryanair said it was cancelling more than 250 flights with more likely, branding the strike 'grossly unfair'. Ryanair is cancelling more than 250 flights, with a spokesman branding the strike action as 'grossly unfair' A spokesman for the budget airline said: 'Ryanair regrets to inform customers that it has been forced to cancel over 250 flights on Wednesday due to a French Air Traffic Control strike. 'Further cancellations and delays are likely and customers should check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport on the Ryanair.com website, where the latest information will be published. We sincerely apologise to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the EU and French authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption. 'It's grossly unfair that thousands of European travellers will once again have their travel plans disrupted by the selfish actions of a tiny number of French Air traffic Control workers.

Ronaldo celebrates after scoring his first goal (vs Deportivo in 2009, above), and his most recent (below) THE TOP 10 ONE-CLUB SCORERS OF ALL TIME . 10) Dixie Dean, Everton (1925-37) 383 . Dean is the widely regarded as greatest player to have been born on Merseyside, and scored 60 goals in one league season in 1927/28. Impressed? He achieved that record after fracturing his skull and jaw in a motorcycling accident. Former Everton striker Dixie Dean is widely regarded as the greatest striker ever born on Merseyside . 9) Willy van der Kuijlen, PSV (1964-81) 394 . When his career started in Eindhoven, part of Der Kuijlen's motivation was to work at Phillips. He ended up with almost 400 goals, and was still only capped 22 times by the Dutch national side. Willy van der Kuijlen of PSV runs with the ball in the UEFA Cup match against Bastia in 1978 . 8) Lionel Messi, Barcelona (2004-present) 398* . Staggeringly, this Argentine forward is only 27. As the star of a mightily impressive Barelona team, expect Messi to climb up this list considerably over the next 10 years. Lionel Messi is closing in on the 400 mark with Barcelona and should rapidly rise up the scoring charts . 7) Zico, Flamengo (1971-83 and 1985-89) 401 . An attacking midfielder in the top 10? Often called the 'White Pele', Zico encapsulated a fine generation of Brazilian football, and impressed with his club side in his homeland. Over two spells with Flamengo, it's no wonder he was given a prestigious nickname. Zico of Flamengo takes on Liverpool's (l-r) Ray Kennedy, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen in a friendly . 6) Eusebio, Benfica (1960-75) 474 . Eusebio helped Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies, as well as four European Cup finals. Not just a poacher, Eusebio had it all and the Mozambique-born player was a Portuguese football legend. Eusebio lead Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies with a staggering amount of goals . 5) Uwe Seeler, Hamburg (1953-72) 507 . Up there with Gerd Muller and Franz Beckenbauer as a German great, Seeker was not a giant but a very strong player with fantastic shooting and heading abilities. His tally probably proves that. Uwe Seeler scored over 500 goals for Hamburg and is up there with Franz Beckenbauer as a German great . 4) Jimmy McGrory, Celtic (1922-37) 522 . Regarded as the Hoops' finest ever player, McGrory netted 55 hat-tricks for the club and went on to rewrite the football record books with his unbelievable scoring feats. 3) Josef Bican, Slavia Prague (1937-48) 534 . Slavia were one of the biggest clubs in the pre-war era, led by a striker from a poor family, brought up in Austria. He fled to Czechoslovakia during the second world war, and certainly made his mark. 2) Gerd Muller, Bayern Munich (1964-79) 573 . Muller scored an incredible 85 goals in a single season as Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title in 1972, and was the league's top scorer on seven occasions. Muller spent 13 campaigns with the Bavarian giants and with his goalscoring record, it's no wonder to see him near the top of the charts. Gerd Muller (centre) scored 85 goals in one league season with Bayern Munich and netted 573 in total . 1) Pele, Santos (1956-74) 1088 . Though his official record stands at 643 goals for Brazilian side Santos, and the 1088 includes strikes against a military XI, Pele tops the charts. Is he the best player of all-time, too? Pele unofficially scored 1088 goals for Santos and is widely regarded as the best player of all-time . PS... who are these Premier League sides' all-time top scorers? ARSENAL . 228 - Thierry Henry (1999-2007 and 2012) 185 - Ian Wright (1991-98) 178 - Cliff Bastin (1929-47) Thierry Henry enjoyed a prolific eight-year spell with Arsenal and is the club's all-time top goalscorer . CHELSEA . 211 - Frank Lampard (2001-14) 202 - Bobby Tambling (1959-70) 193 - Kerry Dixon (1983-92) EVERTON . 383 - Dixie Dean (1925-37) 159 - Graeme Sharp (1980-91) 138 - Bob Latchford (1974-81) LIVERPOOL . 346 - Ian Rush (1980-87 and 1988-96) 286 - Roger Hunt (1958-69) 241 - Gordon Hodgson (1925-36) Ian Rush netted 346 times over two spells with Liverpool and is streaks ahead of anyone else in the charts . MANCHESTER CITY . 178 - Eric Brook (1928-39) 166 - Tommy Johnson (1920-30) 153 - Colin Bell (1966-1979) MANCHESTER UNITED . 249 - Sir Bobby Charlton (1956-73) 237 - Denis Law (1962-73) 230* Wayne Rooney (2004-present) Wayne Rooney is just 19 goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton at Manchester United after his recent strike . NEWCASTLE . 206 - Alan Shearer (1996-2006) 200 - Jackie Milburn (1946-57) 153 - Len White (1953-62) Alan Shearer scored 206 goals for Newcastle, while Vic Watson managed 326 for West Ham United . TOTTENHAM . 266 - Jimmy Greaves (1961-70) 208 - Bobby Smith (1955-64) 174 - Martin Chivers (1968-76) WEST HAM . 326 -  Vic Watson (1920-35) 252 - Geoff Hurst (1959-72) 166 - John Dick (1953–63) 166 - Jimmy Ruffell (1921-37)","Cristiano Ronaldo scored 300th goal for Real Madrid on Wednesday night .

104,929791869be6c996e8d9f14626c30f157ed9ed59,"The stage was set for the coronation of King Jimmy on Tuesday but West Indies stubbornly refused to hurry him to his throne. The perfect script for this first Test saw Anderson taking the four wickets he needed to become the most prolific bowler in England’s history in his 100th game with record holder Sir Ian Botham here and waiting to crown his successor. But West Indies made Anderson wait on an attritional day that was in sharp contrast to the excitement provided by the first of this crucial series. Certainly Anderson would not have expected to play a more significant role with bat than ball on the second day of this first Test as West Indies did much to make up for their profligacy in the last two sessions of the first. When Anderson, watched by his wife, two daughters and parents, strode out to bat England had lost five wickets for 20 runs and were in danger of wasting the initiative handed to them largely by Ian Bell’s century. But ‘the Burnley Lara’, of course, is a more than useful No 11 these days and came within 19 runs of a Test century at Trent Bridge last year, so it should not have been a surprise to see him sticking around with Chris Jordan. When the pair were separated after a last-wicket stand of 38 England had moved to within a run of the score of 400 that should have been their minimum target when they were well placed on 341 for four on the first evening. Then it was a question of whether this unassuming Lancastrian could move from 380 wickets to 384 and overtake Botham, who was on hand apparently with a nice bottle of red wine waiting to celebrate, at the top of England’s Test tree. Only it was not quite as simple as that. Modern Test pitches in the Caribbean are notoriously slow and turgid and it was never going to be a case of simply sitting back and waiting for a West Indian collapse. Jimmy Anderson (right) is still three wickets away from breaking Sir Ian Botham's England record . Ben Stokes was England's first man to be dismissed on day two when he edged to Jason Holder in the slips . Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Stokes to take West Indies' first wicket of the day in Antigua . James Tredwell edges a delivery from Holder behind as he is dismissed for eight . Anderson had surprisingly chosen to bowl from the Curtly Ambrose End where the strong cross-wind that blows across this ground would in theory assist in-swing more than his more dangerous out-swinger. But Anderson, who had led England out on to the field in his landmark Test, generally knows what he is doing and successfully targeted the outside edge of the left-handed Devon Smith’s bat with a beauty. It was to prove his only success of a frustrating day. Anderson could make no further inroads and was surprisingly limited to just four overs after tea as the other England bowlers were forced to share the load and three more wickets. Jordan had looked good in making an unbeaten 21 and now he was to again prove himself an all-round cricketer of rich but raw promise, taking the wicket of Darren Bravo and later claiming an outstanding diving slip catch off James Tredwell to send back his old Barbados schoolmate Kraigg Brathwaite. Stuart Broad, who has not been at his best since returning from injury at the World Cup, had earlier ended Marlon Samuels hopes of extending his purple patch against England and West Indies were on the back foot at 99 for four. Jos Buttler fell for a duck despite facing 22 deliveries on the second morning at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium . West Indies fast bowler celebrates after dismissing Buttler for a duck on day two of the first Test . Stuart Broad was England's ninth wicket to fall before Anderson fell for 20 with the score on 399 . Anderson celebrates after seeing Devon Smith edge behind to Buttler to take England's first wicket . Buttler makes the catch from Anderson's bowling to dismiss Smith for 11 and leave West Indies 19 for one . Yet the evergreen Shiv Chanderpaul, who could easily have gone to his first ball, settled in to his old idiosyncratic routine and hung on to the close with the far less secure Jermaine Blackwood, who had a major escape when Stokes had him well caught at slip only to be denied because he had over-stepped. Stokes has previous in this regard, having been denied his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide when he snared Brad Haddin only to overstep again and there is simply no excuse to lose a wicket in this way. The Durham hot-head was clearly ticking afterwards and it can only be hoped that he did not encounter any lockers when he returned to the dressing room, having broken his wrist punching one in Barbados last year. West Indies finished on 155 for four having had the better of the second day and leaving England with much to do if they are to secure the win here that would be so important to them. West Indies were batting earlier than expected because of a poor performance from England in the morning as they replicated their struggles of the first session of the match and crumbled against good pace bowling. Chris Jordan celebrates after dismissing Darren Bravo, who edged behind to Buttler, for 10 . Broad celebrates dismissing Marlon Samuels for 33 to leave West Indies on 89 for three . Tredwell celebrates after seeing Jordan hold onto a catch at first slip to dismiss Kraigg Brathwaite . Stokes was perfectly placed to score his second Test hundred but once he had steered Jerome Taylor straight to gully England worryingly had no answer to what remains a more than useful West Indies pace trio. Most disturbing of all was the performance of Broad, who was once a good enough batsman to score a Test hundred at Lord’s against Pakistan. Now he looks a shadow of a player once thought of as a potential No 7 for England and again looked like he had been affected by being hit in the face by India’s Varun Aaron at Old Trafford last summer. Broad was honest enough to admit during the World Cup that he had had nightmares about the incident that left his nose broken but he was also confident that he was getting back to his best with the bat. It did not seem that way here as he ducked a couple of short balls from Kemar Roach and then, caught on the back foot, slapped a fuller ball to gully. When he fell and England had slumped to 361 for nine the Test was back in the balance but Anderson and Jordan kept England’s noses in front until the wait for Anderson’s big moment began. We are all still waiting. England, meanwhile, should confirm on Wednesday that Moeen Ali will join the squad in time for the second Test in Grenada after successfully coming through his return after injury with Worcestershire. It could mean that Adil Rashid, disappointing in the warm-up in St Kitts, is released to return to Yorkshire, who have been frustrated by the sight of four of their players being in the England party but not included in this first Test.","West Indies reach 155 for four at stumps on day two of first Test .

The 29-year-old actress made the admission in a newly-released PSA for the Center of Reproductive Rights, an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom, in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic. 'In 2007 I became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time,' she says in the video, which appears on the website for the center's Draw the Line campaign. 'My life just wasn't conducive to raising a happy, healthy child. I just didn't think it was fair. So I decided to get an abortion, and I went to Planned Parenthood.' Scroll down for video . Abortion advocate: Girls actress Jemima Kirke, 29, spoke out about her abortion in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights . Costly procedure: Jemima says she needed her boyfriend's help to pay for the procedure, and even then she could not afford anesthesia . While she was able to easily access the local clinic in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school, Jemima says she faced numerous other hurdles to obtain her legal abortion. 'Because I couldn't tell my mother that I was pregnant, I had to pay for it out of pocket,' she explains. 'I did have to like, empty my checking account, what I had in there, and get some from my boyfriend. 'I realized that if I didn’t take the anesthesia, I would be able to afford to do this. The anesthesia wasn’t that much more, but when you’re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars, it is a lot. I just didn't have it.' Jemima says that it's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights. '[Abortions are] not completely unavailable, and that's the tricky part,' she says. 'We do have free choice, we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them.' Speaking out: The actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time, and she has since given birth to a daughter named Rafella Israel Mosberg . It is not the first time that Jemima has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions; in a 2012 episode of HBO series Girls, Jemima's character Jessa had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion. While she eventually realized that she wasn't actually pregnant, the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation. In reality, women have to jump through numerous 'hoops' before they can undergo the procedure, including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion, legal impediments, and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states. According to the Guttmacher Institue, 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance, 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket. There are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay; from 2011 to 2013, more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade, including gestational limits, state-mandating counseling, and waiting periods. Bold show: In the first season of Girls, Jemima's character Jessa schedules an abortion but doesn't go through with it; her character later has a miscarriage . Similar storyline: In 2012, 858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of Girls in which Jessa plans to get an abortion . The actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject, and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences. 'I've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women, especially, should be able to talk about freely,' she says. 'I have always been open about my stories.' Jemima is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children — she has an 8-year-old step-daughter and a 4-year-old daughter with her husband, lawyer Michael Mosberg. 'I would love if when they're older, in their teens or their twenties, that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore,' she said. 'I would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies.'","The actress, 29, says she had to pay out of pocket for her 2007 abortion because she couldn't tell her mother .

Tragedy: Pensioner Molly Wood died after being run over by her sister's car in a Tesco car park . Investigation: The 74-year-old died after the burgundy Kia Venga, pictured, had its engine running and 'lurched forward', trapping her under the wheels . Emergency services, including an air ambulance, were called but she died at the scene outside the Tesco store in Pontefract, West Yorkshire on March 25.

West Yorkshire Coroner David Hinchliff said today: 'Both ladies got out and Mrs Wood was standing in front of the vehicle while her sister went for a ticket. 'Mrs Wood was talking to some friends who were also there and it appears the engine was still running. 'It's not clear whether Mrs Wood's sister sat in the vehicle or leaned in but it was at that point that the vehicle rolled forward hitting Mrs Wood causing her to be trapped under the vehicle.'

Scene: Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, was on a shopping trip with her younger sister, who was also injured . Detective Sergeant Ann Drury said: 'The incident took place around midday on Wednesday, March 25 when the car, a burgundy coloured Kia Venga, was unoccupied and lurched forward colliding with two women who were standing towards the front of the vehicle. 'As a result of injuries sustained in the collision, a 74-year-old woman from Knottingley died at the scene. 'The other woman, 70, was not seriously injured in the incident but has been left badly shaken by what took place. 'This was a very tragic incident and I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision and is yet to speak to police.'

In one text, the man referred to himself as her 'future hubby' and promised to buy her shoes when he met her. He also sent her a picture of himself in one message, and told her: 'Wow I knew you beautiful but damn you are super beautiful.' After asking how 'his in-laws' were, he said: 'I'm hope I'm not being too, how can I say, forward.' The man repeatedly sent Ms Berry messages featuring photos of himself and kissing emoticons .

There will be a capacity of 7,000 for July's match against France at London's Queen's Club, but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in Glasgow for last month's first round. The rest will go to various organisations and governing bodies, with a considerable percentage going to well-heeled Queen's members as part of the deal to play the tie there. British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer . Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp . The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19. Murray has an affinity for The Queen's club, having won the AEGON title there three times . Murray is currently practicing in Spain before beginning his clay court campaign later this year . The above will have until May 27 to take up or return their tickets, with only around 2,500 guaranteed to reach the ordinary public. A minimum 2,000 per day will then go on sale to those who are British Tennis Members – something that anyone can become by joining free – while at least 500 will go to supporters who have travelled abroad in recent years to support the British team. 'We have obligations to certain groups within the tennis family,' said an LTA spokesman. 'There are restrictions on numbers at the venue and we have to work within that.' Andy Murray, who has won the AEGON title three times, will lead the GB team in the match that takes place from July 17-19. France have seven singles players in the world's top 50, with their best grass court player Jo Wilfried Tsonga having just recovered from injury. The former Wimbledon champion – currently practising in Spain before beginning his Spring clay court campaign – is pleased with the venue, and may be called upon to play doubles as well as two singles matches.","Davis Cup quarter-final tickets will be hard to find for fans this summer .

And the Southampton defender, who is being tracked by Manchester United and Chelsea, has fuelled talk that he could quit St Mary's this summer by insisting he wants to play Champions League football. Clyne's excellent displays for the Saints have thrust him into the forefront of Hodgson's plans. Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne poses with a WWE title belt while attending a pay-per-view event . Clyne joined Carlton Cole (left) to speak at at a Football Fighting Ebola event in London . He has started England's previous four matches - including the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovenia and Lithuania. Tottenham's Kyle Walker and Arsenal's Calum Chambers are also in contention for England's right-back berth - but Clyne has revealed Hodgson has told him the shirt is his as long as he keeps on performing. Speaking at the Football Fighting Ebola fundraising event in London, he said: 'Roy just said that ""You’ve done ever so well since coming in. It’s like you have been playing international football for a long time. The right back spot is yours at the moment, if you can continue on"". 'I’ve settled in well with the England squad. If I keep on putting in performances and keep on improving as a player, I can hopefully make the position my own and look to make tournaments and hopefully win tournaments with England as well.' Southampton have opened talks with Clyne, who was spotted at a WWE event in the capital on Monday night, over a new contract but face a huge fight to keep him beyond the end of the season. United are understood to be leading the race to land Clyne in the summer, but Chelsea have entered the race for his signature. The Southampton defender has been linked with a move to Chelsea and Manchester United . And the 24-year-old has openly admitted he is eager to start his Champions League career. 'I see myself hopefully playing in the Champions League and competing for titles and trophies. That’s what I’m aiming for,' he said. 'I’m definitely ambitious. Every player would love to be playing Champions League and winning trophies and titles. 'That’s what you play football for, that’s the dream. 'I would say Champions League is the next step in my progression. I think I need experience playing European football. 'We’re doing well with Southampton. Hopefully we can get there.

There are also pictures from Szczesny's childhood and family holidays as the goalkeeper turns 25 . Szczesny was clearly touched by the efforts of his girlfriend and took to Instagram on Monday to thank her. 'Best birthday ever!' he wrote. Arsenal's triumph over Reading sees them reach the FA Cup final for the second consecutive season, having also won the competition last year against Hull City. This year, it will be Tim Sherwood's Aston Villa who stand between the Gunners and more glory, after they defeated Liverpool in the other semi-final on Sunday. Szczesny joined Arsenal's academy in 2006 from hometown club Legia Warsaw and graduated to the first-team in three years later. Although he has racked up nearly 200 appearances for the north London outfit since then, this season has raised question marks over Szczesny's long-term future. He was caught smoking in the wake of Arsenal's 2-0 Premier League loss at Southampton on New Year's Day and has only made Cup appearances since then.

After going back inside his house to find he son missing, he made the horrifying realization that he backed over Jackson with his truck. Jackson was hit by the front wheels of the vehicle backing up and when the front wheels back around, he essentially walked right into the side of the vehicle. 'When I got out of the truck, I hopped out of the truck to run to the back door and hopped up on the stoop and the back door was wide open,' Brian said. Bayer said he wishes he could have done something to prevent his son's cruel fate and describes himself as the kind of father who would check the floor to make sure there was no change or small objects his son could accidentally swallow. 'I went flying out the back door basically to see him on the driveway, and um…he had already been hit at that point in time and I had backed over him,' he added.

117,dce1580f3a2630564b7cbad90216ed75a00318cf,"Kent Sprouse was put to death by lethal injection Thursday night in Texas. Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. He died 22 minutes after being injected and is now the fifth inmate to be executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row: Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . In his final statement shortly before he was killed, Sprouse said; 'I would like to apologize to the Moreno family and the Steinfeldt family for all of the trouble I have caused them. 'I would like to apologize to my family for all of the trouble that I have caused them. I would also like to thank my family for all of their support. I guess that’s it.' Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) and customer  Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said that a recent purchase of pentobarbital meant they had enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.","Kent Sprouse, 42, died of a lethal injection Thursday in Texas .

It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page. Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years. Payday: Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped, it's been revealed . Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million. His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content. The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year. Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. It does not include changes in the present value of pension benefits, so the AP total can differ slightly from the total reported by company.

Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday that he won't sign a religious freedom bill that his state's legislature sent to him on Tuesday, citing influence from his politically liberal son. He is sending it back to lawmakers, he told reporters, for amendments that will bring it more in line with the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act – which critics say better protected the rights of gays and lesbians. Hutchinson said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law. 'My son Seth, signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Hutchinson said. 'And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that ... there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues.' Seth told Daily Mail Online that 'I love and respect my father very much, but sometimes we have political disagreements, just as many families do.' 'I had communicated with him my opposition to the bill, along with thousands of other Arkansans and concerned citizens around the country,' he added. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Gov.

LIKE FATHER, LIKE – WHOA! The Republican governor's son Seth, pictured in a Barack Obama shirt, signed a petition asking his dad to veto the religious freedom law . About 200 demonstrators flooded the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Tuesday after the  bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature . 'I’m proud to have made a small contribution to the overall effort to stop discrimination against the LGBT community in Arkansas, the state that I love (Go hogs!),' the younger Hutchinson said. Seth works as a labor organizing coordinator for the Austin, Texas flagship office of the Texas State Employees Union. 'Most importantly,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'I hope that the groundswell of grassroots opposition to HB 1228 and other similar discriminatory bills around the country will energize more Americans and help create a long-lasting drive for change in this country, on many issues.' His father told reporters hours earlier that the bill on his desk carved out too much new territory. 'The bill that is on my desk at the present time does not mirror the federal law,' Hutchinson said. 'It doesn't mirror it in a couple of ways, particularly allowing the First Amendment to be asserted in the private litigation between parties or reliance on the state law in those claims.' 'Therefore I asked that changes be made in the legislation and I've asked that the leaders in the General Assembly to recall the bill so that it can be amended.' The White House jumped into the fray on Wednesday, with spokesman Josh Earnest telling reporters that the Arkansas legislation could 'be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love.' 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to,' Earnest said. 'And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry.' Hutchinson didn't cite any pressure other than his son's, however. 'My responsibility is to speak out on my own convictions,' Gov. Hutchinson said at the state Capitol, 'and to do what I can as governor to make sure that this bill reflects the people of Arkansas, protects those of religious conscience – but also minimizes the chance of discrimination in the workplace and in the public environment.' The unusual move – sending the legislation back without actually vetoing it – means Hutchinson doesn't risk a veto-override in the state legislature. Lawmakers could refuse to amend the bill and force his hand, or they could do what he asks. Josh Earnest . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reacted during his daily press briefing on Wednesday: . 'The piece of legislation that was passed by the Arkansas legislature tracked closely with the legislation that was passed by the Indiana legislature last week. 'The kind of outcry that we saw in response to the Indiana legislation being signed into law by Governor Pence is similar to the outcry that we saw in Arkansas last night after the legislature passed that legislation. 'We saw, you know, some pretty strong criticism including from some pretty prominent business leaders in the state of Arkansas expressing some concern about the impact of that law, and that that law could justifiably – or could be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love. 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to. And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry. 'But you know, obviously the next step will be for the leaders in Arkansas to determine. I think we've made pretty clear what our views are on that.' The governor has one other option: He said he's considering issuing an executive order to clarify that 'Arkansas wants to be a place of tolerance.' His concern that the bill went further than the 1993 law signed by then-President Bill Clinton was akin to complaints that critics raised this week in Indiana, where a similar law took effect on Monday. One key detail in Indiana's version – and Arkansas' – expands the idea of giving conscientious Christians a way to defend themselves if they're sued when their businesses refuse to provide services for gay weddings. They protect against civil suits filed by private individuals, not just those pursued by the government. But few civil-rights suits are filed and funded by allegedly harmed people. State- and federal-level commissions and law-enforcement agencies typically carry them forward. And Indiana University law professor Deborah Widiss told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Religious Freedom Restoration Act laws have not 'been a sort of blank check to discriminate.' At issue is whether a Christian-owned business could legally deny services to gays if doing so would conflict with their religious values. Typically, the issue is raised when same-sex couples seek vendors for their weddings. 'Let me make it clear,' Hutchinson said Wednesday: 'This law under consideration does not extend discrimination. That's important.' 'What is important from an Arkansas standpoint is one, we get the right balance,' he said. 'And secondly, we make sure that we communicate we're not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace, our economy and our future.' At the same time he seemed to defend the idea of having a law that protected the religious-express rights of business owners. 'This bill simply defines the standard to determine the right balance' between those rights and those of gay men and women, he said. Hutchinson had initially supported the bill and on Tuesday his office said he planned to sign it. 'This is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial, but these are not ordinary times,' he said Wednesday as Americans watched his quick 180-degree turn. Hutchinson spoke to reporters outside his office at the state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday, saying that he wants a religious freedom law changed so it better reflects a federal law that took effect in 1993 . DAD-WHISPERER: Seth Hutchinson seems to have had an outsize influence on his famous dad . As Arkansas braced for the possibility that it would become the new religious-freedom ground zero, Wal-Mart, the state's largest for-profit employer, had insisted that the new legislation was a bad idea. Those objections were unexpected in some corners because the massive big-box chain is seen as a rare bastion of Christian values in a crowded secular marketplace. The Walton family, the company founders who still own a large stake, are famous for using leadership models culled from Christian service traditions. Wal-Mart also is known for selling enough Christian-themed books to worry some religious bookstores. Yet Doug McMillon, the company's CEO, signed a statement saying that the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act 'threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold.' 'Every day in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve,' McMillon said. Arkansas legislators defied widespread criticism in passing the bill on Tuesday. A similar measure that Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed into law a day earlier became an instant national flashpoint in the gay rights debate. It took Pence less than a day to capitulate to protesters, saying in a press conference that he would work with legislators to 'fix' the law's language. FLASHPOINT: Rallies like this one in Arkansas ould spread to the other 19 states where versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are already on the books . Arkansas state Rep. Bob Ballinger (right) sponsored the bill and was all smiles when it passed, but now his brainchild is in limbo . 'WE WILL FIX THIS': Indiana Gov. Mike Pence told reporters on Tuesday that he wants legislation on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that his state's new religious freedom law does not allow discrimination . Wal-Mart isn't the only big player that would have complained if Hutchinson had signed the bill. NASCAR said in a statement Tuesday that it was 'disappointed' by Indiana's legislation, and would likely pile on in the Razorback State. The NCAA, which has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1999, says it is concerned about the law's effect on future Indiana events including this week's Final Four men's basketball tournament. The governors of New York, Vermont, Washington and Connecticut have announced bans on certain state-funded travel to Indiana. Mayors of Denver, Seattle and Washington, D.C. have followed suit for city-funded travel. Those restrictions could have quickly doubled in size to include Arkansas. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that the Indiana law 'flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the Arkansas bill would be equally offensive to the Obama administration.","'My son Seth, signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Republican Gov.

A secret meeting between intelligence figures in Moscow and Washington reportedly revealed Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region. Notes from the meeting are also said to have revealed that Putin is planning imminent 'destabilising actions' in pro-Western Baltic states in a direct challenge to Nato's promise to defend the countries from Soviet-style Russian expansionism. These disturbances are thought to likely involve cyber attacks or ramping up local ethnic tensions in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania intended to unsettle the region. Threat: Vladimir Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region . Notes from the top secret meeting between American and Russian officials in Germany last month have reportedly been seen by The Times. They suggest Russia is prepared to respond with force to the build up of Nato defence forces in the Baltic and by carrying out a wave of cyber attacks that can not be traced back to Moscow. The Kremlin officials - who were briefed by Russian Foreign Minister Segei Lavrov before the meeting and spoke of behalf of Putin - are said to have issued 'a spectrum of responses from nuclear to non-military' in response to the growing Nato army in the region. As well as the situation in the Baltics, two other potential flashpoints were reportedly identified that could lead to nuclear war between Russia and the West: the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, and any future attempt to return the annexed Crimean peninsula to Ukraine. Firepower: Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukrainian military (pictured) - who hope to defeat pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country - as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border . In Crimea, Russia is understood to have said that any attempt remove the region from Russian control would be met 'forcefully including through the use of nuclear force'. Meanwhile, Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukraine in the hope of defeating pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border. 'The Russian people would demand a forceful response [to such advances]', the Kremlin intelligence chiefs reportedly added. It is the threat posed by Russia to the Baltic states that is thought to be imminent, however, after Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all raised concerns that Moscow has ambitions in the former Soviet territories, prompting Nato to establish a 'rapid reaction force' in the region. The threat of a Russian invasion of the countries is currently considered so great that Lithuania has gone as far as to reintroduce conscription in order to ensure it is prepared for all out conflict. Ready for conflict: Soldiers take part on in action training near the eastern city of Mariupol in Ukraine . News of the growing tensions emerged as a new men's clothing label launched in Russia in the hope of cashing in on the wave of patriotism currently sweeping the country. The move comes ahead of a giant military parade planned in Red Square on May 9 to mark the 70th anniversary of end of the Second World War underscoring the decisive contribution of the Red Army to defeating Hitler and the Nazis. Unveiled at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Moscow, the brand is called The Army of Russia. The design bureau of the Russian Defence Ministry, headed by Leonid Alexeev, showcased balaclavas, shiny 'military boots', sweat pants and tops emblazoned with the slogans 'Army', 'Polite', and 'Politeness conquests the cities'. 'Polite' is a phrase used by Russians to justify their takeover of Crimea last year. It refers to pro-Moscow forces' apparently 'polite' requests for the dramatically outnumbered Ukrainian security personal to leave the region.","Russian intelligence chiefs took part in secret meeting with U.S. officials .

Rubbish collectors will continue to rake the decomposing fish, a small silvery species called twaite shad, off the water's surface until the the mass dying subsides.

But Alexandre Fernandez, rowing coach of Botafogo club based in Rio, said he had no worries about the phenomenon and  believes the cause was natural, not because of pollution.

However, several scientists have rejected that explanation, saying that pollution is really to blame. Estefan Monteiro da Fonseca, an oceanographer at Fluminense Federal University, said the official explanation 'makes no sense'.

He said: 'The lake continues receiving large quantities of sewage.' He added that it has large concentrations of sulfur because of the organic material dumped into it, and depending on the wind, that material rises to the surface and kills fish.

127,c4c46eb3bcb0a1b5fecb21e6ea8ccf23f46655c2,"A widow who was left £15million by a high-rolling gambler has launched a multi-million pound lawsuit against his family – claiming she is owed up to £385million more. Ruanne Dellal says her husband Jack was worth at least £400million when he died and the £15million left to her was an ‘absurd presentation’ of his true wealth. The former beauty queen has launched a High Court claim against his relatives, in which she claims the property tycoon must have given away vast chunks of his fortune in secret deals to his family. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Jack Dellal left his whole estate to wife Ruanne, but she is suing after discovering that it amounts to just £1.7million . Daughters: Mrs Dellal is suing six of her husband's children, including Gabrielle, left, and Jasmine, right . Mrs Dellal, 61, whose own assets have been valued at £41.5million, says she is owed a ‘reasonable provision’ following the death of the legendary gambler. Her late husband, known as ‘Black Jack’, was a regular at the gaming tables of casinos in Mayfair and Monaco and gambled £1.7million in a single night in 2006. His family dispute his widow’s allegations and the true extent of the tycoon’s wealth will now be scrutinised by the High Court, which will assess Mrs Dellal’s claim that she has been short-changed. She claims six of his children are the supposed beneficiaries of his alleged secret handouts. Siblings Lorraine, Diane, Gabrielle, Jasmine and Rowan were named along with son Guy, the father of Agent Provocateur lingerie model Alice Dellal. His grandson Alex and elderly sister Violet were also named. Yesterday, they failed in a bid to persuade a judge to throw out her claim before it could come to trial, setting the scene for a potentially explosive court battle. Mr Dellal, who was friends with celebrities including Sir Mick Jagger, was notoriously secretive about his financial dealings but is said to have gambled millions every year, regularly winning or losing up to a £1million a night. He died in October 2012, aged 89, and left his entire estate to Mrs Dellal, his second wife, with nothing to his six adult children from previous relationships as he said he had already made provisions for them. Mrs Dellal, a former Miss South Africa, received £15.4million and he also put £20million in a trust fund for their two children, now aged 15 and 12. Son: Guy Dellal, pictured with his wife Andrea, is also being sued by his stepmother over his father's will . Granddaughters: Guy is the father of model Alice Dellal, left, and shoe designer Charlotte Dellal, right . But she claims his fortune appears to have shrunk mysteriously between his 2006 will which named her as his sole beneficiary and his death six years later. Mr Dellal, who was born in Chorlton, Manchester, to Iranian émigré parents, made a fortune in textiles, merchant banking and property and his wealth was once said to top £1billion. Jack Dellal was the son of immigrants from Baghdad, and he started his career as a humbile textile dealer in his home city of Manchester. He became a multi-millionaire after starting a small banking business called Dalton Barton, which he sold to the bank Keyser Ullmann in 1972 for £58million - more than £700million in today's money. Mr Dellal used the proceeds of the deal to set up Allied Commercial Holdings, which he used as a vehicle for property dealings for the rest of his life. In 1989, he made a vast profit from the purchase of Bush House on the Strand in central London, which was the headquarters of the BBC World Service. Allied Commercial bought the building for £55million in 1987, and sold it on to Japanese firm Kato Kagaku for £130million just two years later. His final big deal came with the sale of the Art Deco Shell-Mex House, overlooking the Thames, which raked in a £150million profit when it changed hands in 2007. He had a son and four daughters from his first marriage to a former Israeli air stewardess, which ended in divorce, and two daughters from another relationship. He married his second wife in 1997 and transferred assets worth around £56million to his six eldest children shortly after that wedding. By 2007 the couple’s marriage was in trouble and they each consulted two of Britain’s leading divorce lawyers, Raymond Tooth and Sandra Davis. Records of those meetings, revealed to the High Court, were said to show Mr Dellal did not dispute he was worth £400million. The couple did not divorce, but Mrs Dellal claims her husband began funnelling huge amounts of money into trusts for his children without her knowledge, and had a £50million ‘secret stash’ hidden in an account. In his written ruling, High Court judge Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Dellal had argued a ‘strong’ case that her husband had access to ‘very considerable resources’, but said there was little evidence he had given it to his children in secret. He said: ‘It goes like this. If Jack was very rich, and if his estate appears to have mysteriously shrunk, then the money can only have gone to his blood family. There are no other candidates.’ Mr Dellal’s family asked the judge to throw the case out as they said she cannot prove he gave money to them. They also argued Mrs Dellal’s wealth meant there was ‘no prospect’ of the court awarding her any more money. She owns an £8.5million mansion in Regent’s Park, central London, a £3million townhouse in Mayfair, the couple’s £5million home in Hampshire, a £1.1million house in Cape Town in South Africa, cars, jewellery and art worth almost £6million and has investments in the Middle East worth £26.5million. Grandson: Art dealer Alex Dellal, pictured with his wife Elisa and their son Jack, is the son of Guy . She claims her fortune has been ‘somewhat diminished’ recently, although Mr Dellal’s relatives argued that was down to her own mismanagement. Mr Justice Mostyn said it would be unfair to dismiss Mrs Dellal’s case without further scrutiny of her late husband’s finances. No date has yet been set for the case to be heard.","Jack Dellal left his entire estate to wife Ruanne but it was worth just £15.4m .

Nicholas Pence, 25, and his father David, an oil company manager, had been celebrating a victorious football game in their garage in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Wednesday. But moments after jovially waving goodbye to the last-remaining revelers shortly before midnight, they were both shot dead at close range in an attack that shocked and baffled the quiet community of Metairie. They were found by David's wife, Nicholas's mother, who had been in a bedroom when she heard gun shots. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Nicholas Pence, 25, (left) and his father David, 56, (right) were shot dead 'execution-style' at home on Wednesday night after a football party in their garage, or 'man cave'. Police believe it was a botched burglary . Tragic: They were found lifeless by Elizabeth Pence (center), mother to Nicholas (second left) and wife to David (right) moments after the shooting, which has left the quiet neighborhood of Metairie in mourning and shock . Charged: Police arrested Dexter Allen, 17, (left), and Haraqyon Degruy, 18, (right) in connection with the killings . On Sunday, police revealed 18-year-old Haraqyon Degruy and her friend Dexter Allen, 17, have been charged with the double killing. Neither have a 'significant' criminal history, officers revealed. The police investigation has failed to determine at link between the alleged assailants and their victims, or a motive. David Pence, a manager at a New Orleans branch of the international oil firm Baker Hughes Inc, was shot three times in the chest while sat in an armchair. Nicholas was shot in the face and back. He was found lying on the floor of their so-called 'man cave'. Elizabeth Pence dialed 911 to report the shooting, and the theft of her purse, iPod and iPhone. Friends of Nicholas, known to friends as Nick or 'Peezy', have set up a fundraising page to supplement funeral costs and support his surviving mother and sister. The family lived on Clifford Drive, a leafy part of Metairie, which is one of New Orleans' wealthier areas . Initial reports suggest it could have been a botched armed burglary, as Allen and Degruy were linked to earlier car break-ins. Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said: 'Once again, this particular happenstance was completely, totally, shock-the-conscience type of homicide — obviously execution-style, very close.' Members of the community have expressed their horror, describing Nicholas and David as outgoing and lively neighbors. 'They were very good people. They got along with everybody.' close family friend Paul Meyer told WWL TV. 'I can't comprehend how someone could do this to a family like that.' Another friend said he was in the garage with Nicholas just minutes before the murder. Police believe 17-year-old Allen fired the fatal shots before running to the car and saying 'I just shot two people' to Degruy, who allegedly drove off, the New Orleans Advocate reported. Degruy has been charged with two counts of being an accessory  to first-degree murder and one count of vehicle burglary. Allen is being held on charges of fleeing police and two counts of first-degree murder. Weapon: Col John Fortunato of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office holds the heavy-duty gun which authorities believe was used to kill David, an oil company manager, and his son Nicholas after their party this week . A police report says the younger Pence had pointed out a suspicious white Toyota crawling through the street . Neighbor and friend Michael Soignet has described the agonizing moment Mrs Pence returned to the address, saying: 'She just gave me a strapping hug, and I choked up. She choked up. There were just no words.' Describing the victims to The New Orleans Advocate, she said: 'You'll never find anybody that's going to throw out a bad word on them, and if somebody does, they don't have their story right. 'This had to be a random act. It had to be.'","Nicholas Pence, 25, and his father David, 56, had friends round to celebrate a victorious football game on Wednesday in their rural New Orleans home .

129,1ca36d545c702dec959bd0a59ae1870da8536793,"This eighteen-month-old boy pulled a rice-cooker brimming with boiling water down on his head, burning deep scars into his face and leaving him almost blind. As a crack team of surgeons from the Australian charity, Interplast, worked last March to save the sight of little baby Seng, from Vientiane, Laos, inspirational burns survivor Turia Pitt watched on. Turia was deeply moved by the plight of the baby with big, brown eyes. That's because she knows that if she lived in a country like Seng's, she wouldn't be here. Foreign doctors wouldn't have been able to save her from the flames that nearly killed her by lashing 64 per cent of her body with burns in 2011. 'I wouldn't have survived,' she said during a candid interview ahead of hosting a fundraising gala on Thursday which aims to raise funds for more volunteer medicos to head overseas to save lives and livelihoods. 'If I was from Laos or Bangladesh, no ifs or buts, 100 per cent I would have died.' Scroll down for video . Stronger than ever and inspired by a little burned baby: Turia Pitt (pictured), who experienced burns to 64 per cent of her body during a September 2011 ultramarathon through the Kimberley, Western Australia . Burned by boiling water: Little baby Seng (left) is pictured being operated upon by surgeons in Laos (right) in a desperate attempt to save his sight. Turia Pitt witnessed the operation . Seng's sight was saved by keen doctor volunteers from Interplast. Turia told Daily Mail Australia Seng was 'for sure' one of her inspirations in working for Interplast . Fitter and stronger than ever: Turia Pitt's recovery from the horrific burns that left her clinging to life is inspirational. She recently ran a half-marathon and beat the time she ran before the 2011 Kimberley blaze . Turia, who has been operated on more than 200 times since she was caught in the flames, believes Australians take their medical system for granted. Her remarkable recovery is a case-in-point. Few would have thought she would be more athletic now than she was before she was seared with burns while running the Kimberley ultra-marathon three-and-a-half-years ago. 'I'm fitter now than I was before!' Turia told Daily Mail Australia. Nervous about medical complications, Turia was 'dumbfounded' when she ran a half-marathon last month at a quicker pace (1hr 45mins) than her time before she was burned (1hr 50mins). The only difference was that she needed to douse herself in water every 5km, as her skin has lost the ability to keep her temperature stable. Powered by a fierce determination to prove herself, Turia Pitt is fitter than ever, embarking on a ferocious fitness program in a bid to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. The six-day-a-week program features three major planks, working on the burns victim's already impressive cardio fitness, strength and flexibility. If it sounds daunting, never fear - even Turia admits she struggles with staying motivated sometimes. 'All of us make excuses, don't we? I think it's a normal thing to do... I think it's part of being human.' THE PROGRAM . CARDIO : 2 x 2.5k swims per week and she runs around 30kms a week . STRENGTH: 2 personal training sessions per week, involving conditioning exercises including box-jumps and squats . FLEXIBILITY: 2 yoga sessions each week, 'just to get a good stretch' 'Maybe I've got something to prove... I think I am more motivated' Asked about what motivates her to keep so fit, she told Daily Mail Australia there are bigger obstacles in life than running a marathon. 'Maybe I've got something to prove.... I think I am more motivated,' she said, revealing her intense, six-day-a-week training regimen. She is hoping to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. 'Compared to what I've been through, things like doing a marathon are rather minor by comparison.' There were many dark moments during her recovery, she said - ones that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but that of others. Turia experienced many dark moments during her recovery that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but others as well . Her partner Michael Hoskin (left, pictured during a hike recently) has been Turia's most steadfast supporter throughout the entire ordeal . On Thursday, Turia will hold a gala to raise funds for the same charity that saved Seng's sight, Interplast. She will also provide an update on how Seng is progressing . 'There were terrible moments when I just wanted to give up,' she said. Not self-conscious: Turia Pitt has always taken pride in her appearance . Only recently she had a scare on the operating table when she stopped breathing while surgeons were attempting to install her new nose, terrifying her partner, Michael Hoskin, and mother Celestine Vaite, who been by her side throughout the entire journey. 'I guess I was really blessed because I was surrounded by a really good support team, my partner (Michael), my family, my friends, the doctors, the nurses, even my local community of Ulladulla. 'In those really hard times I did draw strength from the people around me'. Given the nature of her work with Interplast, appearance was another topic Turia dwelled upon while talking to Daily Mail Australia. She said she has always taken pride in her appearance, which hasn't changed. The burns don't concern her - instead, they are something she is accustomed to. 'Let's say you're at a party and you're self conscious and you think your arse looks big,' Turia said. 'Every time someone looks at you, you going to think, ""they're thinking my arse looks big"". 'But if you aren't really thinking that at all, you won't see it. 'I'm not looking for people who are looking at me. 'But then, if I was really self-conscious, I'd probably notice it a lot more - because I'm sure there are people who do look at me.' Years after the disaster, life is something close to normal now for Turia, who lives life according to a simple creed. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' she said. 'And that's kind of what I've always done.' As for baby Seng, it is understood his big, brown eyes can see again - perhaps allowing him to live a life with the same clarity of purpose as Turia. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' Turia Pitt told Daily Mail Australia. That is the simple creed by which she lives her life .","Baby Seng, from Laos, is the little boy who touched Turia Pitt's heart .

He is a very talented player but the English club buys very often but seldom sells.' Jovetic looks likely to leave the Etihad this summer after being omitted from the club's Champions League squad earlier this season to make room for January signing Wilfried Bony.

Karen Buckley vanished after a night out in the city at the weekend, sparking a four-day police search which yesterday found her body at High Craigton Farm.

Former colleagues and friends in her hometown in County Cork, Ireland today remembered the 'beautiful, smiling' 24-year-old who was dedicated to helping the injured and sick. Her father, John, said yesterday that he, Miss Buckley's mother Marian and her brothers Brendan, Kieran, and Damian are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Friends and family have paid tribute to Karen Buckley - pictured with her brothers (l-r) Brendan, Damien and Kieran - after a four-day police search found her body yesterday . Her body was found at High Craigton farm after a huge search was launched to find her earlier this week . Miss Buckley's former supervisor at the Hibernian Hotel in the town of Mallow told the Irish Independent: 'She was always smiling, no matter how hard the work. She could never do enough to help you.' Karen’s former  school principal, Susan O’Keefe, said: ‘She was a beautiful girl and she was a great pupil. 'It’s sad. We are here on a fine summer’s day but Karen is not. We’re all just the worse off for such a lovely person been taken from us, and for everyone in this community, it is a shocking tragedy.’ Karen was a ‘great all-rounder’, participating in ladies’ football with Clyda Rovers and athletics with her school in Analeetha, Ms O’Keefe added. ‘At that time we were a much smaller school then we are now, so we were just like a big family. It is a big blow.' Yvonne Bane, the principal at Miss Buckley's former school in Mallow added: 'The community in St Mary's Secondary School is united in grief at the sad news concerning Karen Buckley, a former student of our school who completed her Leaving Certificate here in 2009. 'A prayer service took place in the school this morning, with all students and staff of St. Mary's Secondary School in attendance. We offered prayers for Karen and her family at this difficult time. Police initially searched a park in Glasgow, but attention later switched to the farm six miles from her home . Floral tributes were left at the scene after her family told of their 'absolute heartbreak' at her death . A vigil will be held in Glasgow today as friends and family tell of their shock at this week's events . 'The school community have been sharing warm memories of our beautiful, former student over the last number of days.' And a spokeswoman for the University of Limerick, where Karen studied nursing, said: 'Karen was a very valued member of the UL Community as well as the wider nursing and medical communities in Limerick, having spent time working in both the University Hospital Limerick and the University Maternity Hospital. 'The thoughts of the entire UL community are with her parents and family and her wide circle of friends as well as her UL classmates and medical colleagues.' A 21-year-old man was arrested in connection with Ms Buckley's death yesterday. He made a brief appearance in a private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court today. Friends of Ms Buckley raised the alarm on Sunday morning when she failed to return from a night out at The Sanctuary in the west end of Glasgow. The search led police to Dawsholm Park, where Ms Buckley's handbag was found on Tuesday, and a property in the city's Dorchester Avenue, before the farm where the discovery was made. Ms Buckley moved to Scotland in February and was a first-year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian University. Miss Buckley's parents, Marian and John, came from Ireland to help the search for their 'cherished' daughter . Miss Buckley grew up in the town of Mallow, County Cork, whose residents expressed shock at her death . Her family, who travelled to Scotland on Tuesday, have said they are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Her father John Buckley, 62, said she was an outgoing girl who 'thoroughly enjoyed life'. He released a statement through Police Scotland which read: 'Marian and I, together with our sons Brendan, Kieran, and Damian are absolutely heartbroken. Karen was our only daughter, cherished by her family and loved by her friends. 'She was an outgoing girl who travelled the world, where she met lots of people and thoroughly enjoyed her life. We will miss her terribly.' More than £50,000 has been raised to support the Buckley family in an online drive organised by her former classmates at Limerick University. The 24-hour appeal closed last night after reaching £50,001 - ten times the initial target of £5,000. The Go Fund Me page was set up to cover the family's travel and expenses while in Scotland and to support the upkeep of their farm in Cork.

Art, design and photography community BoredPanda has created a thread encouraging parents to upload cute images of their babies showcasing their parents' 'true nerdy colors.' And of course, obliging parents have taken to the thread with professional photography shots of their trussed up newborns. Dressed as characters ranging across fantasy and sci-fi movies, books, TV shows and comic books, the adorable babies are seen in different scenarios and positions that have clearly been carefully arranged by their parents. A few of the images have even been subject to careful doctoring via Photoshop, in order to make the scenarios more realistic. Spiderman's a popular choice! Another baby is pictured alongside toy replicas of his superhero comrades . These babies are dressed as Star Wars Jedi knights, complete with light sabers and the characteristic brown cloak . One baby has been incorporated into a complicated Harry Potter scenario, complete with round-framed glasses, suitcases for Hogwarts and a magic wand . Some parents have really taken the geek-factor to the next level and have dressed their babes as characters from sci-film films such as Star Wars. One baby is seen as Princess Leia, surrounded by cuddly toy versions of the characters, while she herself is laid comfortably in the middle, wrapped in lace swaddling and sporting a hilarious knitted version of the famous hair-buns. Another baby is dressed as a Jedi, wrapped in a brown cloak characteristic of the monastic characters with an illuminated lightsaber propped up next to him. One newborn is kitted out as widely-recognisable Nintendo character Mario, complete with tiny dungarees, the red flat cap and even a fake felt moustache. To complete the illusion, the baby has been gently laid on an old-school Nintendo gaming device. Two sleeping newborns have been dressed up as comic book characters.

Other babies have been dressed up like characters from well-known children books. One soundly-sleeping newborn has been incorporated into a scenario from J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter franchise. The baby sports the character's signature round-frame glasses, while laid on top of a pile of suitcases - possibly alluding to his journey to wizarding school, Hogwarts - and is surrounded by the world-famous books, as well as a makeshift wand. Another little-one is undoubtedly dressed as Alice from Lewis Caroll's much-loved, Alice in Wonderland. The sleeping baby sports a blue ribbon hairband and clutches a pocket watch as well as a toy replica of the grinning Cheshire cat.

133,41c6edecee127c396d17e2e9115a4a89252cc52b,"(CNN)The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to ""gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements,"" the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward ""other remedies to enhance pipeline safety,"" according to the commission. ""PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust,"" commission President Michael Picker said. ""The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again."" The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. ""Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno,"" Tony Earley said. ""We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten."" On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data.

134,20e6d0d3071c6588894885da2c015064095c66af,"A US citizen has been killed in a mortar attack in Yemen after he traveled to the country in an attempt to extricate his pregnant wife and daughter from the civil war there and fly them  to California, family say. Jamal al-Labani was an Oakland gas station owner, his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told KPIX-TV. According to Alazzani, al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Alazzani told KPIX al-Labani was trying to get his family out of the war-torn Middle Eastern nation and take them to Oakland - but he couldn't because the US has withdrawn its diplomatic staff and the country has shut down most airports. Rebels from the Houthi Islamist group have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. They have advanced to the city center despite 11 days of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition of mainly Gulf air forces. Scroll down for video . Family: Jamal al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's 2 1/2-year-old daughter . Attack: Jamal al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died . Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia launched the air strikes on March 26 in an attempt to turn back the Iran-allied Shi'ite Houthis, who already control Yemen's capital Sanaa, and restore some of Hadi's crumbling authority. The air and sea campaign has targeted Houthi convoys, missiles and weapons stores and cut off any possible outside reinforcements - although the Houthis deny Saudi accusations that they are armed by Tehran. Career: al-Labani reportedly wished to take his family to Oakland, though there was no way to do so given what has been happening in Yemen . The fighting has failed so far to inflict any decisive defeat on the Houthis, or the supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh who are fighting alongside them, but the growing death toll and humanitarian suffering has alarmed aid groups. Speaking to CNN, al-Labani's family said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died. Council for Islamic Relations spokeswoman Zahra Billoo told CNN: 'All of these other governments, Russia, China, Ethiopia, India ... they have all been evacuating their citizens. 'So to say that it's impossible for the U.S. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp.' In a statement issued to the television station, the State Department said 'We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. 'U.S. citizens wishing to depart [Yemen] should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available. 'Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others.' At the time of the attack al-Labani was with his teenage nephew, who was also killed, Al Jazeera America reported. Alazzani told the news outlet that ahead of the attack '[al-Labani] was trying to find a way out because he felt his family was in danger.' He also told Al Jazeera America Houthi forces launched the mortal shelling on Tuesday. al-Labani's sons from an earlier marriage reside in California, according to Al Jazeera America. They are reportedly 13 and 16 years old. In a message posted Friday on its website, the State Department said 'On February 11, 2015, due to the deteriorating security situation in Sanaa, the Department of State suspended embassy operations and U.S. Embassy Sanaa American staff were relocated out of the country.' 'The level of instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain severe,' the message said. 'There are no plans for a U.S. government-coordinated evacuation of U.S. citizens at this time.' The agency also warned 'Keep vital records and travel documents close at hand; U.S. citizens should be prepared to depart at a moment’s notice. The airports are currently closed, but may open unexpectedly; other unforeseen opportunities to depart may also suddenly arise.' Houthi fighters and allied army units clashed with local militias in Aden on Sunday, and eyewitnesses said gun battles and heavy shelling ripped through a downtown district near the city's port. The United Nations said on Thursday that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in Yemen, while the International Committee of the Red Cross has appealed for an immediate 24-hour pause in fighting to allow aid into Yemen. The ICRC, which has blamed the Saudi-led coalition for delays in aid shipments, said it received approval to fly in medical supplies and staff and hoped to send two planes on Monday. A spokesman for the military coalition said the ICRC had approval to fly in aid on Sunday but pulled out because of problems with the company from which it chartered a plane. Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri also said a Sudanese flight was prevented from landing at Sanaa on Sunday by authorities in the Houthi-run capital, and a Turkish evacuation flight was held up. 'Usually, the delay is because of the other side,' he said. A pro-Hadi militia source said 36 Houthi and allied fighters were killed on Sunday in Aden's central Mualla district, near the port, while 11 of Hadi's combatants died. Houthi forces initially advanced towards the port area, but hours later had been pushed back several streets towards an army base. 'There are bodies in the streets and we can't get close because there are Houthi snipers on the rooftops. Anything that gets near they shoot at, and the shelling on Mualla has been indiscriminate,' a medic told Reuters. Asseri said the coalition was providing pro-Hadi fighters with intelligence, equipment and logistics. 'We hope in a few days they will control most of the city,' he told reporters in Riyadh. Valentina Abdul Kareem, an Aden council member, called on both sides to implement a ceasefire so that civilians could be evacuated. 'Aden is going through a humanitarian and health crisis,' Abdul Kareem said. Residents and merchants said stores had largely run out of produce, milk and other foods due a lack of access to the rocky peninsula city, whose main routes to agricultural hinterlands lie through the battle zones. Victim: al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving an Aden mosque Tuesday and soon died. His 14-year-old nephew was also reportedly killed . Business: al-Labani owned this Oakland, California, gas station . Armed: Followers of the Houthi movement raise their rifles as they shout slogans against the Saudi-led air strikes in Sanaa, Yemen on Sunday. Houthi forces have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi . At least two main city districts have been without power for days after a rocket knocked out a main power station on Friday, and other areas suffered repeated cuts. Water has also been cut from some central districts. Asseri said that was a deliberate policy by the Houthis to create a 'chaotic situation' in Aden. Both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis say they are ready for talks which could return Yemen to the political transition which started when Saleh stood down in 2012 following huge street protests against his rule, inspired by wider Arab uprisings. But they have set out incompatible conditions for the talks and neighboring Oman, which often steers an independent course in the Gulf and has stayed clear of the Saudi-led military operations, said last week that neither side was ready for negotiations. A senior Houthi member said on Sunday the group is ready for peace talks as long as the Saudi-led air campaign is halted and negotiations are overseen by 'non-aggressive' parties. The fighting is only one of many conflicts in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest nation, which also faces tribal unrest, a simmering separatist movement in the south, and a threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in the east. U.S. military personnel carrying out a covert drone war against AQAP were withdrawn last month after the Houthis advanced south towards Aden, close to the base out of which they operated. In the eastern coastal town of Mukalla, tribesmen deployed on the streets, pushing al Qaeda fighters out of much of the town just three days after the militants overran it, residents said. The tribal fighters entered Mukalla on Saturday, pledging to restore security after the militants broke into its jail on Thursday, freed a local al Qaeda leader, ransacked banks and took over local government buildings. France said its navy evacuated 63 people including French nationals from Aden on Sunday. Turkey said it evacuated 230 people, including non-Turkish citizens, by plane from Sanaa.","Jamal al-Labani was a Oakland, California, gas station owner, as well as a husband and a father-of-three .

135,6d9493fe42df31e6e18b3345652a0d748820589f,"Ian Murray reckons a supposedly easier run-in can swing second place Hibs' way ahead of Rangers in the last month of the Championship season. His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again  in the final weeks of the campaign. But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long. Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in . Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'","Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes Rangers' tough run-in could mean they miss out on second place in the Scottish Championship to Hibernian .

He was then shifted into the shipping container, complete with medical equipment, and lifted with a crane down on to a flatbed truck. Michael Raia of the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health & Human Services said planning for the move began weeks ago. Mr Raia said the new facility is better equipped to help Butler.

138,c34d84d38ccfd021ba0b3712dc23feadd455af5b,"(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama ""L.A. Law,"" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning ""That Championship Season,"" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed ""L.A. Law"" — created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher — aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. ""I always had him in mind for that role,"" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. ""He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect."" ""We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,"" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. ""Sometimes I worry — it's all been going too well — a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!"" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm ""Day One"" and in the ABC miniseries ""War and Remembrance,"" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm ""Truman,"" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in ""Meteor"" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing ""The Hospital"" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in ""Being There"" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982) and a physician in such films as ""The Terminal Man"" (1974), ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" (1985) and ""Warning Sign"" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm ""Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair"" and in Mario Van Peebles' ""Panther"" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's ""Petulia"" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in ""Pale Rider"" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" (1987); and sold barbwire in ""Back to the Future III"" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of ""The Iceman Cometh"" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in ""All in Good Time,"" ""The Little Foxes"" and ""A Place Without Doors."" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in ""That Championship Season."" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including ""The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder"" (1974), ""The Day of the Locust"" (1975), ""The Hindenburg"" (1975), ""An Enemy of the People"" (1978), ""Prophecy"" (1979), ""Mask"" (1985) and ""Hard Rain"" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" (1974), ""The People vs. Jean Harris"" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in ""The Last Days of Patton"" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in ""Malice in Wonderland"" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the ""L.A. Law"" reunion telefilm of 2002. ""They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,"" he said of watching ""L.A. Law"" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News.

Tong Shao, a chemical engineering student at Iowa State University, went missing in September 2014. After a three week search, police found her body stuffed in the trunk of her Toyota Camry in Iowa City. Shao's boyfriend, Xiangnan Li, 23, was listed as a person of interest in the case and is believed to have been the last person to see her alive, however he bought a one-way ticket to China in the days after his girlfriend went missing and has disappeared, CNN reported.

Li had transferred to Iowa from Rochester Institute of Technology to be closer to Tong. The two had meet studying English in Beijing in 2011. They had checked into a hotel room together on September 5, 2014. The pair had stayed at the same hotel three times before and the owner knew them. According to police records obtained by CNN, two days earlier Tong had accidentally called Li - or 'pocket dialed' him - and he stayed on the line for 30 minutes, overhearing a conversation. Tong was complaining about Li to a friend and said things that 'were not nice', the records noted. The owner of the hotel told investigators Li left the hotel either on the night of September 6 or the morning of September 7, which he said was unusual, because he usually had to tell the couple to leave after the checkout time of 11am. Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8. He landed September 10. Before Li left Iowa, a text from his phone was sent to one of Tong's roommates. 'This message was purportedly from (Tong) and read that Li had an emergency in China and was flying back there, that she was going to take a bus to Minnesota to visit friends, and she would return in about a week,' the police documents stated. On September 9, Karen Yang, a friend of Li's sent him a message asking how things were going with Tong. 'Fine for now,' he replied. Killed: Tong Shao, 20, was found dead in her Toyota Camry on September 26 at an apartment complex in southeast Iowa City. Police believe she had been in the car for three weeks . Disappeared: Police say Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8, less than two days after his girlfriend was last seen alive . Tong's roommate, Jean, filed a missing person report on September 18, when she couldn't contact her. Together her roommates reached out to Tong's friends in Minnesota via social media, however they had not heard from her. On September 26 were body was found in her car parked near a low income housing complex on the outskirts of Iowa City. Residents had reported a foul smell, and responding officers wore Hazmat suits while inspecting the car, KCCI 8 reported at the time. Tong was found in the trunk, where her body had been for about three weeks, and next to her was a 15-pound barbell. An autopsy showed Tong died of  asphyxiation and blunt force trauma. A towel from the hotel had been wrapped around her head, according to police records. Inside the car police found copies of Li's flight information. Scene: Investigators had to don Hazmat suits to inspect Tong's car. Her body is believed to have been in the trunk for three weeks before they found it . Investigation: Tong died of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. Her body was wrapped in a towel, and next to it was a 15-pound barbell, police say . Stench: Investigators grimace at the smell emanating from Tong's car after finding it dumped in September . A search of their hotel room found 'splatters and drips of various dried liquids throughout the room and behind the headboards of the beds,' the records said, concluding that 'it is possible her death may have occurred in the hotel room'. Tong's father, Chunsheng Shao, told CNN he was informed by detectives last month that an arrest warrant had been issued for Li. Li is wanted for the first-degree murder of Tong Shao. Police would not confirm this, saying their investigations are ongoing. While it is the first break in the case since the discovery of Tong's body, Mr Shao says he wants more to be done in solving his daughter's murder. Mr Shao and his wife saved $100,000 to send their daughter to university, and believed Iowa would be a quiet, safe place for her. 'We've given all our love to our daughter'"" Mr Shao said. 'I feel my life is meaningless after losing her.' Tragic: Tong, a junior chemical engineering student from China, was last seen in Ames more than three weeks before her body was discovered . While the U.S. has strong ties with China, there is no extradition treaty between the two. Legal experts say the most likely outcome is that China would prosecute people within China for crimes committed elsewhere. For Mr Shao, more needs to be done. 'We now plead with you, the U.S. authorities ...  share the evidence you have gathered with the Chinese authorities,' he said. 'This honorable act could very well save the life of other innocent and vulnerable victims, and will most assuredly allow the soul of our precious daughter to be comforted and rest in peace.'","Tong Shao, 20, was an international student from China attending Iowa State University .

His tiny face is coated in dust from the debris that crashed around him as the earth shook on Saturday, April 25, killing more than 5,000 people and injuring at least twice as many more. His name is Sonit Awal, and he's just four months old. On Saturday, Sonit was at home in Muldhoka, Bhaktapur, east of the capital Kathmandu, when the 7.8-magnitude quake sent tremors through Nepal and neighboring countries, according to Kathmandu Today. The house collapsed, burying the child, leaving his father Shyam Awal frantically searching for him amid the rubble. A desperate Awal called the Nepalese Army, and they too scrambled through the dirt and debris until midnight, before giving up hope and leaving. Sonit's father had lost all hope of finding his son alive, the paper reported, until he heard faint cries from below. On Sunday morning, the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted Sonit clear of the fallen rocks, beams, bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours. His rescuers held him high in their hands to the sun, though his eyes were still wedged tightly shut. Sonit's face was exposed during the whole ordeal, though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble.

A Florida man who was high on a designer drug called Flakka stripped and ran naked through traffic in Fort Lauderdale to escape from imaginary killers who he believed stole his clothes and wanted to murder him. Matthew Kenney, 34, told police he smoked Flakka before he streaked though traffic early on Saturday evening while only wearing a pair of sneakers. Flakka, which can be injected, snorted, smoked, swallowed or taken with other substances, has been nicknamed '$5 insanity' for its mind-bending effects and cheap cost. After he was arrested, Kenney told police he would 'rather die than be caught by these unknown people', the Sun Sentinel reported. He added that 'if I got hit by a car they would stop chasing me' according to a Fort Lauderdale Police reported. Kenney has previous arrests for disorderly conduct, making a riot and possession of a controlled substance. He was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation. Flakka is usually made from the chemical alpha-PVP, a synthetic version of the stimulant cathinone. That is the same type of chemical that is used to make bath salts. Scroll down for video .

143,7752c685358c5badf6dd5f3798386e9ff64dac3c,"A South Australian law professor has said that police acted ‘outrageously’ by subjecting a woman to an oral swab test after she was reported for flashing her breasts. Karen Davis, from Port Pirie in South Australia, notoriously flashed her K-cup breasts on Google Street View and was reported by police with disorderly behaviour. She handed herself into police voluntarily. However, ABC News reports that South Australian law professor Rick Sarre believed it should not result in charges or a court appearance and that the swab was unnecessary. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . ‘I think it's outrageous, but I know young juvenile offenders who have been questioned over certain things who have had the same thing happen to them,’ he said. 'That behaviour's being defended by the police commissioner, who says ''that's what happens these days''. ‘That doesn't surprise me because unfortunately that's the kind of law and order climate in which this Government has pushed us in the last dozen years.’ The 38-year-old was captured streaking by a camera car for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. Police released a statement alleging the 38-year-old mother 'pursued' the Google car to make sure she was captured exposing herself, and that it was an illegal act. 'The woman’s actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals and the public expectation is that we take action,' said Superintendent Scott Denny of Port Pirie police. 'Recently in Port Pirie we arrested a man for exposing himself in public - this incident is no different. 'It is not appropriate for anyone to expose themselves in public places. Our community should be able to expect a bit of decency.' In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Ms Davis, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at the controversy caused by her actions, claiming that 'flat-tittie chicks' are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Ms Davis had issues with her size-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I  always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.","Karen Davis was photographed on Google Street View flashing her breasts .

144,9f81c3049ff1b636ba416283ba4f5326fd578cc8,"She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match. The 29-year-old from Chicago has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder affecting 1 in 20,000 which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen or other unusual places in the body. Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class. The brunette - who currently works for a non-profit addressing the legal rights of intersex individuals - immediately phoned her mother to discuss her suspicions and was shocked to find her worst fears confirmed. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis (above) was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match . Flashback: The 29-year-old (seen above circa 1990) has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen . 'I was like, ""Oh. My. God! That's the thing the teacher was talking about ... ,""' Pagonis told the Associated Press. 'And then I went into like a freefall.' Two decades ago, there was little information about AIS and Pagonis' parents were'n't sure how to talk openly about the condition. Pagonis was born with an enlarged clitoris, no uterus and a partial vagina that surgeons later extended so that as an adult she might have normal sexual intercourse. However, Pagonis says she learned as a teenager that this was 'almost impossible'. Undescended testes were also removed from her abdomen to prevent them from developing cancer; although some doctors now think affected children can be monitored instead. For a long time Pagonis struggled with depression and angst until meeting young intersex adults who've embraced their differences. Growing pains: Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class . Body confident: Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon,' doesn't identify as female or male and works as an artist and intersex activist against surgery . Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon', doesn't identify as female or male and works as an intersex activist against surgery. Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Pagonis' advice for parents with intersex infants? 'Take them home and love them ... just the way they are.' Alice Dreger, a Northwestern University ethicist and author, says it makes sense for parents to raise affected kids as boys or girls. 'But sometimes we get that gender assignment wrong. And in those cases it's particularly important that we've not done unnecessary interventions.' Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who is genetically male (who has one X and one Y chromosome) is resistant to male hormones (called androgens). As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman, but the genetic makeup of a man. It is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body unable to respond to the hormones that produce a male appearance. Complete androgen insensitivity prevents the penis and other male body parts from developing. At birth, the child looks like a girl. The complete form of the syndrome occurs in as many as 1 in 20,000 live births. How many male traits people have differ in incomplete AIS. A person with complete AIS appears to be female but has no uterus, and has very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics - such as breasts - develop. However, the person does not menstruate and become fertile. Persons with incomplete AIS may have both male and female physical characteristics. Many have partial closing of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short vagina. Complete AIS is rarely discovered during childhood. Sometimes, a growth is felt in the abdomen or groin that turns out to be a testicle when it is explored with surgery. Most people with this condition are not diagnosed until they do not get a menstrual period or they have trouble getting pregnant. Incomplete AIS is often discovered during childhood because the person may have both male and female physical traits. Tests used to diagnose this condition may include blood work, genetic testing or a pelvic ultrasound. When it comes to treatment, testicles that are in the wrong place may be removed when a child finishes growing. Estrogen replacement can also be prescribed after puberty. SOURCE: MedLinePlus . Vocal: Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Idea exchange: It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions . Pagonis hopes that by speaking out about her condition she can help comfort others with AIS. Efforts in the medical sphere also are underway to change the way intersex children are treated. 'The way that we took care of things in the past... where there was a fair amount of secrecy, where there was surgery done in the infant state, and potentially irreversible surgery, is probably not the best way to go about things,' said Dr. Earl Cheng, who runs the two-year-old sex development disorders program at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital. The program is one of several nationwide that employ a team of specialists including surgeons, hormone experts, genetic counselors, psychologists and ethicists. The team helps families weigh their options, including whether surgery should be considered at all. It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions. Some affected children have typical male or female chromosomes, but genetic glitches and hormonal problems that begin in the womb, cause genitals to resemble those of the opposite sex. Others have a male-female blend of sex chromosomes and reproductive organs.","Jennifer Pagonis has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)

Their first target: the Johannesburg suburb of Jeppestown, where xenophobic violence broke out on Friday. South African police raided a Jeppestown hostel Tuesday while troops secured the perimeter. Earlier, Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula announced the plan to deploy an undisclosed number of troops to areas where police are spread too thin while trying to curb deadly attacks against immigrants. ""This intervention is not an indictment on the police. ... We are coming in because they need that support,"" she said after visiting Johannesburg's Alexandra township, one area where mobs have attacked immigrants from other African nations and looted their shops -- ostensibly based on the belief that immigrants are taking South Africans' jobs. Seven people have been killed in recent violence against poorer immigrants, many from South Africa's neighbors. Xenophobic killing caught by photographer . Much of this month's violence happened in the port city of Durban, where at least two foreigners and three South Africans were killed after mobs with machetes attacked immigrant shops. Thousands of people took temporary shelter at refugee centers or police stations as a result, according to aid group Gift of the Givers. Similar violence happened late last week in Johannesburg, where immigrant-owned shops were looted or destroyed. The attacks came as residents accused immigrants of taking their jobs and committing crimes. The unemployment rate in South Africa is 25%, according to government figures. The United Nations said the attacks began in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. What's behind the xenophobic attacks in South Africa?

Dyche, 43, has a growing reputation having overseen a remarkable transformation of fortunes since arriving at Turf Moor in October 2012. The former Chesterfield defender made a nonsense of the relegation favourites' tag to lead the Clarets to an unlikely promotion from the Championship to the top flight last season. Burnley veteran defender Michael Duff is preparing to take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday . Duff has backed his manager Sean Dyche to one day take charge of the England team . The 37-year-old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of United . This term they are attempting to defy the odds again and with eight games remaining they have a fighting chance of survival in the Barclays Premier League. Burnley are next in action on Sunday when they host Tottenham. Duff, 37, said: 'He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager. 'Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and (Burnley will) achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here.' Asked if he would be surprised if former Watford boss Dyche ever managed England, Duff said: 'No, in a word, having worked with him and the way he gets the best out of players. 'Most of our players have played the majority of their careers in the Championship or lower than that and we are competing against multi, multi-million pound squads and we are alive and kicking. 'So, he has managed to get the best out of us. If he can do that at a higher level, why not?' Duff has hopes of following Dyche into management himself after retirement. The former Northern Ireland international still intends to prolong a career that has seen him play in the country's top-eight tiers with Cheltenham and Burnley, but he has firm plans for life beyond it. He said: 'I've done my Pro Licence and I want to stay in football after I've finished playing. 'I have no plans to stop playing at the minute. I still love getting up for training in the morning. It's not a bad job running around chasing after a football. 'But you look at the game differently when you get to my age. The Pro Licence is nearly all based on management, so you look at sessions differently, look at the manager's presentations - and this one isn't a bad manager to learn from.' Dyche has improved Burnley's fortunes since he took over at Turf Moor in October 2012 .

Rugby prop Dale Forrest, 26, of Bolton, would sink up to 12 pints a night, but decided to shed the pounds after seeing a photo of himself while out with his fitness fanatic friends. In December 2013, the bank teller decided to ditch the booze, give up his favourite fatty readymeals and greasy takeaways and hit the gym. Dale Forrest would drink up to 12 pints a night - and ballooned to 24 stone - before giving up beer to lose weight . Dale, pictured at his slimmest, was worried he would look like a 'beached whale' next to his friends on holiday . Since then, Mr Forrest, who had a holiday planned with his mates and didn’t want to look like a ‘beached whale’ next to them, has lost 10.5 stone. He said: ‘I can now go on nights out and feel confident - even without the Dutch courage. ‘I no longer feel like people are laughing at me and all it took was a bit of willpower.’ Mr Forrest struggled with his weight from a young age and in adulthood fell into unhealthy habits. Before shedding the pounds Mr Forrest ate a cheese and sausage bap for breakfast, a Big Daddy Box Meal from KFC for lunch and a meat feast pizza for dinner. Dale, pictured sitting down, said he would consume beer, alcopops and shots regularly on nights out . Dale, pictured before his weight loss (right) and after losing 10 stone, gave up greasy takeaways for healthy foods and started going to the gym regularly, and saw the pounds fall off . Despite being a rugby player, Dale weighed 24 stone due to his unhealthy lifestyle . He said: ‘I was inactive and ate and drank what I wanted. ‘All my friends were in really great shape. They got a lot of attention from girls and I got none, which was a bit depressing. ‘They were all quite careful about what they ate, but I thought nothing of having dinner at McDonald's regularly.’ Despite being a keen rugby player, Mr Forrest rarely exercised and lived on an unhealthy diet – and would regularly drink 12 pints of beer followed by shots and sugary alcopops on a night out with friends. He said: ‘I would drink in the pub with my friends every Friday and Saturday. ‘I would start off by having a few pints, then as I got a bit bloated I would switch to other drinks. By the end of the night I was downing Jaegerbombs and drinking alcopops.’ After a night out in December 2013, Mr Forrest logged on to Facebook to look at the pictures taken the night before. Dale is now taking part in a charity boxing match since losing weight . Dale, pictured before (left) during a rugby game, and (right) after losing more than 10 stone . He was horrified to see that he was nearly double the size of all his friends. He said: ‘I was shocked when I saw how big I was compared to my mates. ‘Me and the lads had just booked a holiday for the summer and I did not want to be the beached whale at the side of the pool. ‘I decided I had to change.’ Desperate to change, Mr Forrest set his alarm for 6am the next day so he could go to the gym. He said: ‘I had to drag myself out of bed - during the walk to the gym I felt like death and I struggled to find any motivation. ‘When I got to the gym things changed. I started with some weights and then did 15 minutes on the crosstrainer. ‘After I finished I felt I had achieved something, although it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. ‘I got a taste for it and started going all the time.’ Dale said he would start the night drinking beer and then move on to shots and alcopops . Dale (left before losing weight) turned his life around and lost more than 10 stone thanks to healthy eating . The committed slimmer also overhauled his diet, swapping fatty takeaways for lean meat and fresh vegetables. Before his dramatic weight loss Mr Forrest would snack on chocolate bars and gorge on a fat-rich diet. Now he eats porridge with blueberries for breakfast, grilled turkey with boiled potatoes and vegetables for lunch and grilled fish with green vegetables for dinner. Throughout the day he snacks on nuts, fruit, celery and protein shakes. He also started going to the gym twice a day, weightlifting before work and doing cardio in the evening. By February 2014 Mr Forrest had lost an impressive 3st 7lb. He said: ‘The biggest change was kicking the booze. I still go out now but I've changed my drinking habits. ‘I drink lime and soda throughout the week and I'll switch to gin and tonic on a Saturday night. ‘Within four months people started to notice I had lost weight. My work clothes started getting really baggy as the weight fell off. ‘It was a good feeling every time I needed to go down a size, but it cost me a fortune to keep refreshing my wardrobe.’ Since losing more than ten stone, Mr Forrest has dropped from a 48-inch trouser waist to a 34-inch waist. He now weighs in at an even 14 stone. He is planning on taking part in a charity boxing match on April 18 for Cancer Research UK. He said: ‘I've changed my lifestyle completely. It was a lot of hard work - but it is the best thing I have ever done for myself.’","Dale Forrest would go out drinking regularly and would eat fatty food .

Meteorologists say early indicators show that an east coast low – the same weather system that lashed the state's east coast for three days last week – could hit the region, with heavy rain possible from Thursday. The State Emergency Service was deluged with calls for assistance last week and has more than 4,000 jobs from the 24,196 requests still to be completed. SES spokeswoman Stephanie Wills says the organisation is concerned that more storms will these hamper clean-up efforts. Scroll down for video . Meteorologists say early indicators show an east coast low – the same weather system that lashed the state's east coast for three days last week – could hit again bringing heavy rain from Thursday through to Saturday .

Residents who have been hit by wild weather across New South Wales are being warned to brace for more floods and damage with another storm predicted to hit this week . People struggle against the heavy rain and strong wind on the streets in the Sydney CBD last week . 'Any weather that strikes up north is of concern to us, especially considering the devastation from the storm that hit last week,' Ms Wills told Daily Mail Australia. 'Any water is going to hit that saturated ground and raise flood levels again, and any wind is going to knock over the trees that are uprooted.' Ms Wills said the SES was particularly worried about the effect more wild weather would have on the Hunter region, which suffered through flooding and high winds in the last storm. 'That's our focus - the Hunter region - because they've been smashed,' she said. 'We really are quite concerned about that particular area. 'We are urging the community to prepare themselves, prepare their homes and prepare their families to prevent further loss and devastation.' Weatherzone meteorologist Kim Westcott said a trough of low pressure was forming along the coast, and would hit heaviest in the far northern parts of the state.

'It looks like we could get an east coast low later on this week, but it is certainly a different kettle of fish than we've seen last week,' Ms Westcott said. 'The difference is that it is a little bit further away from the coast and it is in a different area - so the heavy rain is probably not going to be over Sydney.' Ms Westcott said the weather system appeared to be moving quickly. 'We might get two days of rain but it's not likely to be the same three days of wind and rain we saw last week,' she said. Damage and destruction caused by flooding in Stroud in the NSW Hunter region . Bureau of Meteorology NSW regional director Barry Hanstrum said: 'Early indications suggest the main impacts of intense rainfall and strong winds will be on coastal areas in the states north east including the Northern Rivers and Mid North coasts, with heavy falls also likely for southeast Queensland. 'Current guidance suggests that rain will increase this week, and peak between Thursday and Saturday. 'Further rainfall is likely for catchments that have already experienced flooding during last week’s severe weather event.' The Bureau Of Meteorology said it was too early to tell how severe the weather system would be. Ms Wills said the SES would spend the next few days trying to complete as many jobs as possible, as well as warning people to prepare their homes should another severe storm hit.

150,06082afd11670f7820481e4d677e931e77375cf8,"Their parents came to the U.S. for opportunities and now these four teens have them in abundance. The high-achieving high schoolers  have each been accepted to all eight Ivy League schools: Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and Yale University. And as well as the Ivy League colleges, each of them has also been accepted to other top schools. While they all grew up in different cities, the students are the offspring of immigrant parents who moved to America - from Bulgaria, Somalia or Nigeria. And all four - Munira Khalif from Minnesota, Stefan Stoykov from Indiana, Victor Agbafe from North Carolina, and Harold Ekeh from New York - say they have their parents' hard work to thank. Now they hope to use the opportunities for good - whether its effecting positive social change, improving education across the world or becoming a neurosurgeon. The teens have one more thing in common: they don't know which school they're going to pick yet. The daughter of Somali immigrants who has already received a U.N. award and wants to improve education across the world . Star pupil: Munira Khalif, from St. Paul, Minnesota, says she has always been driven by the thought that her parents, who left Somalia during the civil war, fled to the U.S. so she would have better opportunities . Munira Khalif, who attends Mounds Park Academy in St. Paul, Minnesota, was shocked when she was accepted by eight Ivy Schools and three others - but her teachers were not. 'She is composed and she is just articulate all the time,' Randy Comfort, an upper school director at the private school, told KMSP. 'She's pretty remarkable.' The 18-year-old student, who was born and raised in Minnesota after her parents fled Somalia during the civil war, she said she was inspired to work hard because of the opportunities her family and the U.S. had given her. 'The thing is, when you come here as an immigrant, you're hoping to have opportunities not only for yourself, but for your kids,' she told the channel. 'And that's always been at the back of my mind.' As well as achieving top grades, Khalif has immersed herself in other activities both in and out of school - particularly those aimed at doing good. She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13. Incredible: Munira, pictured speaking at Malala Day at the UN, hopes to study political science at college . High achiever: She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13 . She launched a non-profit group, Lighting the Way, to make education more accessible for East African youth, especially girls, through scholarships, libraries and improving sanitation issues. And she was also appointed as A World at School Global Youth Ambassador to promote universal education. Khalif, who plans to study political science at college, said she has yet to decide where to go and plans to visit a few more campuses before she makes her final decision. As well as the Ivy League schools, she also received offers from Stanford, Georgetown and the University of Minnesota - and she's still letting the realization sink in. 'I was very surprised,' she said. 'I am humbled to even have the opportunity to choose amongst these schools because they are all incredible places to learn and grow.' The Bulgarian housekeeper's son who couldn't speak English a decade before he was accepted to 18 top schools in the U.S. Driven: Stefan Stoykov cried on his first day of school because he could not speak a word of English but he is now a straight-A student committed to helping other pupils with language barriers . When eight-year-old Stefan Stoykov moved from his family's one-bedroom apartment in Bulgaria to the U.S. after his parents won a green card lottery, he could not speak a word of English. 'I started crying on the first day of class,' Stefan recalled of his first day in the second grade. 'I was scared. I was scared. I didn't understand what was going on around me.' But now 18 and a senior at North Central High School in Indianapolis, Indiana, he has been accepted into some of the finest schools in the world - and he admits he can hardly believe it. 'It is an incredible feeling,' Stefan told WTHR. 'I never knew that I would have a chance to choose from possibly the best schools from the world. 'I was hoping to get into at least one of the Ivy Leagues.' But as well as getting offers from all Ivy League schools, 10 other prestigious institutions also came knocking. He has yet to decide where he will go. He revealed that hard work and the support of his mother, a housekeeper, had helped him achieve his goals. Shortly after arriving in the U.S., his parents divorced and his father took a job as a truck driver, and he has not seen him much since. Impressive: Despite his early struggles at school, he said he knew that he had to make the most of the opportunities he had been given by his parents when they moved him from Bulgaria to the U.S. 'My parents had done so much to put me in this position, to put me in the United States of America,' he said. 'And I had to take advantage of that. I had to do something with the opportunities they gave me.' Stefan's extracurricular activities include tutoring other students with language barriers, running the cycling club and Spirit Week and joining the stock market club, the Indy Star reported. He is also valedictorian and secured a perfect SAT score by borrowing test guides from the library. He also helps his mother - who spent much of his childhood working so that she could support him - with her housekeeping duties so that it takes her half the time. The son of a Nigerian immigrant who dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon . Hard worker: Victor Agbafe, 17, says he believes his Nigerian immigrant mother set a good example for him in her job as a physician. He now hopes to study microbiology  with government or economics . Victor Agbafe, a student at Cape Fear Academy in Wilmington, North Carolina, has no idea where he will attend college, but he's certain on one thing: he wants to become a neurosurgeon. The 17-year-old was accepted to 14 schools in total, including all eight Ivy League schools and Stanford and Duke. Agbafe, who plans to double major in microbiology along with government or economics, called his acceptance achievement an 'amazing opportunity', WSOC reported. Just before he played a game for his school's basketball team, he learned that Harvard had made a decision about his application - but he waited until the game was over to find out. 'I owed it my teammates to be focused there,' he said. 'I didn't want to get too low on myself if I didn't get in. I also didn't want to get too high if I was accepted.' Going places: The teenager from Wilmington, North Carolina says he plans to visit as many campuses as he can before he makes his final decision by May 1. He hopes to become a neurosurgeon . He has also been part of North Carolina's Youth and Government program, where he was chosen as Speaker of the House. He says his mother, a Nigerian immigrant and physician, set a good example for him - but she refuses to take the credit. 'For God to crown his effort with success is just something that is just beyond me,' his mother Dorothy Agbafe-Mosley said. 'I am very happy that he has all these choices to make. But then it also makes it difficult because it's a lot of good schools. A lot of good schools.' Her son will make a decision later this month after visiting as many campuses as possible. The Nigerian student who credits his Target employee parents with his success . Top student: Harold Ekeh, from Long Island, New York, has been accepted to 14 colleges in total . Ten years after his family moved him from Nigeria to the U.S., Harold Ekeh is hoping to do something for them in return. The 18-year-old Long Islander was accepted by 14 colleges - including all Ivy League schools - and now hopes to study neuroscience to cure Alzheimer's, the disease his grandmother suffers from. The straight-A student at Elmont Memorial High School secured an SAT score of 2270. He also worked as editor-in-chief of his student newspaper and chief executive of the Model United Nations. But he wasn't expecting to get into so many top schools. As well as offers from the Ivy League colleges, he was also accepted by Johns Hopkins, NYU, MIT, Vanderbilt, and SUNY Stony Brook. 'It was crazy,' he told DailyMail.com. 'My mom was sat next to me and it was just letter after letter after letter. I couldn't believe it.' Afterwards 'I went to Chipotle with my friends for a half steak half chicken burrito bowl. It was perfect,' he said. Devoted: He hopes to study neuroscience and find a cure for Alzheimer's, which his grandmother suffers from . He said it was the resilience of his parents, former Target clerks Paul and Roseline Ekeh, that gave him the drive to achieve the best. 'It was such a huge thing for my parents to uproot our family, a family of six, from our home to a new country,' he said. 'I was worried as a kid about speaking with an American accent, but they had to worried about actually finding jobs. They joked that they came over for the 24-hour electricity. But I know it was so we would have opportunities as children. 'No matter how many times they got knocked down, they stayed positive, and kept telling me that the secret to success in unbridled resolve.' He said he is leaning towards going to Yale but will be visiting a few more campuses before making his decision before May 1.","Munira Khalif from Minnesota, Stefan Stoykov from Indiana, Victor Agbafe from North Carolina, and Harold Ekeh from New York got multiple offers .

151,73df16c85afd837cad83f559883f17d077ac51d4,"Comedian Dave Hughes has refused to apologise for calling radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television. Hughes and Hinch appeared on Monday night's Q&A panel discussing depression and alcohol, following the emergence of a video featuring Prime Minister Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a pub. Audience member Lauren Hayes asked Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb if he thought Mr Abbott's  'display of irresponsible drinking was an act of peer pressure or an attempt to become more popular with younger voters'. Scroll down for video . Australian comedian Dave Hughes (pictured) called radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television . This sparked Hinch to question if binge drinking was as prevalent back when he was younger as it was today. But Hughes interjected and said this culture had existed and people drank to get drunk. To which the radio personality replied: 'I drank because I like the taste of wine.' Without missing a beat, the Australian comedian fired back: 'That's because you're a w**ker.' Hinch (above) and Hughes were on ABC's Q&A on Monday night discussing alcohol and depression . But Hinch would not have any of it, saying: 'It takes one to know one.' Hughes told Kiis 101.1 radio he would not recant his comment about Hinch. 'I absolutely stand by it. In that moment, and I think Derryn would agree... he was a w**ker,' the comedian said on Tuesday morning. And the veteran radio personality did not seem to mind the put down. 'I've been insulted by experts so I can handle it,' Derryn told the Melbourne radio station. 'I thought David Hughes was quite quiet last night. The episode came after a video surfaced of Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a Sydney pub on the weekend . Mr Abbott downed a schooner of beer in about six seconds while patrons cheered and encouraged him . 'Normally I look at him and he belongs to that breed of... comedians who think the louder you tell a joke the funnier it gets. I wasn't offended.' On social media, one Twitter user stood behind the radio broadcaster, saying: 'Boogly-eyed comedian Dave Hughes' high-horse 'w**ker' comment was way out of line; great response.' Another called Hughes out by using the comedian's same insult: 'Dave... is a w**ker.' But others were supportive of Hughes' view. '[Hughes] calling [Hinch] a w**ker... gold!' one supporter said. 'Hughesy is winning [Q&A] because you're a w**ker hinch,' another Twitter user said. Monday night's Q&A also saw a more serious Hughes tell the audience about his battles with alcohol and depression. 'When I was 21, I was drinking heavily and smoking marijuana and having sort of episodes at night, and I said to my mum that I think I've got schizophrenia,' the comedian said. 'We went to the doctor together - she was a beautiful mother - obviously, she helped me out. 'The doctor, we had a chat about it. I told him I smoked marijuana and he told me, made me stop doing that. And I did, stopped smoking marijuana and I stopped drinking. 'When I walked out of that doctor's surgery I felt so much better just at having told people about it.'","Comedian Dave Hughes called Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on Monday's Q&A .

152,b0c8b68ef3dfb64b19cc3787e54693f4dd12b5e3,"Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Ed Miliband - and 'risky if you are young, dodgy if you are older' in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Both men were asked their opinion on the practice of sending sexy text messages in a quiz for fashion magazine Cosmopolitan's website. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that it is 'OK for other adults but not for me'. And Education Secretary Nicky Morgan answered: 'A bit too risky, thank you very much!' The verdict: Politicians should not sext, says Ed Miliband (right) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) says it is 'risky' for youngsters and 'dodgy' if you are older . Their responses are hardly surprisingly considering the downfalls of fellow politicians when salacious messages are revealed in the press - including those sent by former MP Brooks Newmark and Tory official Iain Corby. The quiz, which was answered by hand, included a question on the worst thing about politics, which Mr Miliband said was Prime Minister's Questions - 'a bad advert for all of us'. Ms Bennett ticked 'not being able to make the changes you want to', while Ms Morgan opted for people thinking she is boring. Mr Clegg wrote: 'Sitting through 30 minutes of Cameron and Miliband yelling persistently at each other every Wednesday!' The four were also asked about what they would be if not politicians. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that sexting is 'OK for other adults but not for me' Mr Clegg said a wildlife film-maker, while the Labour leader wrote: 'Trying to change the world somehow.' Ms Bennett said she would be an author and Ms Morgan a solicitor. Asked to describe their favourite hangover cure, Mr Miliband said: 'Drinking lots of water but it's been a long time since I had one...' Mr Clegg said: 'Three young boys running around usually does the trick.' Ms Morgan chose a bacon sandwich, while Ms Bennett responded: 'Home-baked gluten-free bread with butter and honey.' In another question, the politicians had to reveal the most hurtful thing they had read about themselves. The Labour leader offered: 'Where do I start?!' and Ms Bennett said a claim that she was trying to be cool, something she says she gave up at the age of 16. The Deputy Prime Minister replied: 'Not hurtful, just absurd - that I have a personal chef! Of course I don't.' Ms Morgan said it was generally people making assumptions about her motives when they have never met her. Another question asked what would be worse than joining the opposition. Mr Clegg said joining Ukip, while Ms Morgan said she would rather join the opposition than do a bungee jump. Ms Bennett and Mr Miliband responded 'none of the above' and 'no way' respectively. It's not difficult to see why the leaders believe politicians should steer clear of sexting as they have plenty of cautionary tales to learn from. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down in May's election after becoming embroiled in a humiliating sexting scandal last year. It was revealed the Conservative member  bombarded a single mother with up to 40 naked pictures and told her 'I am desperate for sex with you'. The father-of-five was forced to issue a grovelling apology after being caught texting explicit photographs of himself for a second time. He had already left his post as minister for civil society after he was exposed as having exchanged photographs with a male journalist posing as a glamorous young Tory PR woman. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down this year after becoming embroiled in two sexting scandals . In April last year, details of salacious messages sent by top Tory official Iain Corby on a gay dating service were revealed. These referred to a sex party for Tory researchers at the party’s annual conference in Manchester, funded by Conservative MPs’ expenses. The Mail on Sunday revealed that the exchanges involved Mr Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses. Disgraced Co-op boss Paul Flowers was suspended from his position after he was filmed buying hard drugs including crystal meth and crack cocaine. The Mail on Sunday revealed exchanges involving Tory official Iain Corby on gay dating service Grindr . The former Labour councillor was further shamed when a teenage rent boy revealed sexually explicit text messages exchanged between them - and revealed he had been asked to accompany Flowers to the summer party of Labour peer Baroness Thornton. And sexting has also caused problems for politicians across the pond. American politician Anthony Weiner, a former representative of the United States House of Representatives, is better known for his two sexting scandals. The first, in 2011, led to his resignation as a Congressman after he sent an intimate picture to a woman over Twitter. And then as he attempted to make a return to politics by running for mayor of New York in 2013, he was forced to admit to sexting three women after pictures were published.","Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Labour leader Ed Miliband .

153,eeaadebf0fc8512031f7b509b236024fd8e7060e,"Melbourne, Australia (CNN)A man stands on a beach in a distant land. Waves lap his ankles. He wades through the gentle dawn light, arms outstretched, his head held high. He is fully dressed; not a tourist but a freedom fighter. A photograph of this man, beamed around the world, becomes a universal symbol of the struggle against tyranny and the sweet triumph of liberty. It is 2015. The man is Peter Greste. If you thought the man might have been an Anzac on the shores of Gallipoli, such is the power of persuasion. It's easy to lead a horse to water when, in the centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign, our nation is at saturation point with battlefield remembrance. The sum total of television programming, beer advertising, political grandstanding and opportunistic marketing suggests that the historical legacy of Australia's involvement in the first world war boils down to a simple equation: young (white) man plus distant beach equals sacrifice. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with military commemoration that honors the dead. Last weekend I planted Gallipoli rosemary in my backyard; part of the proceeds go to the Avenues of Honour, a national project to preserve and restore Australia's living memorials. More objectionable is the fact that war remembrance is played like it is a zero sum game. To widen the scope of historical tribute, and also recall the words and deeds of the Australian men and women who fought against the prescribed route of militaristic sentiment, is to risk being branded disrespectful and divisive. But the unassailable fact is that the first world war ripped Australia asunder. Even at the time, the Great War itself was divisive, a historical reality belied by today's bland, blanket coverage of ""the Anzac spirit"". Australia's participation in the war was contested from the outset. On August 11, 1914, veteran political campaigner Vida Goldstein wrote in her Woman Voter newspaper: ""It is a fearful reflection on 2,000 years of Christianity that men have rushed into war before using every combined effort to prevent this appalling conflict."" As she had done 20 years earlier in mobilizing forces around the issue of female suffrage, Goldstein rallied her own army of foot soldiers with fighting words. ""The time has come for women to show that they, as givers of life, refuse to give their sons as material for slaughter."" Australian and New Zealand women had a unique advantage in shaping public debate: the vote. ""The enfranchised women of Australia are political units in the British Empire,"" Goldstein argued, ""and they ought to lead the world in sane methods of dealing with these conflicts."" Goldstein's early entreaties failed to bite with the general populace. Under the newly legislated War Precautions Act, the Woman Voter suffered censorship, leading Goldstein and her Women's Peace Army to fight on multiple fronts: ""We are fighting for Civil Liberty and against Military Despotism.""  Around the nation, trade unionists opposed to ""the capitalist war"" joined the movement. Australia had the only entirely voluntary military service among the Allied forces; less than 40% of eligible men signed up to fight ""for King and Country."" As the carnage at Gallipoli brought home the realities of war, recruitment fell and peace activism became more widespread. General strikes halted industry, as workers reacted to the food shortages, unemployment and rising poverty that threatened the social accord of ""the Working Man's Paradise."" With enlistments falling away in 1916, Prime Minister Billy Hughes pushed for conscription and pushed through the Unlawful Associations Act. Groups that voiced opposition to the war, like the International Workers of the World, were banned and dissidents were jailed for publishing material ""likely to cause disaffection or alarm"". When waterfront workers and coal miners went on strike, the War Precautions Act was invoked to send them back to work. In September 1916, the Sydney Twelve were arrested and tried for treason. ""Fifteen years for 15 words"" was how one of the prisoners described his crime and punishment. The conscription referendums of October 28, 1916, and December 20, 1917, became a massive rallying point for people who opposed the war — or the federal government's domestic policies. There were diverse reasons for that opposition, including the anti-British sentiments of Irish Catholic Australians. In Melbourne, the meeting place for such public debate was Yarra Bank, a pocket of land nestled between what today is Birrarung Marr and the Rod Laver Arena. Anti-conscription demonstrations saw up to 100,000 people gather on the dusty banks of dirty brown Yarra River. Most protest meetings were peaceful, but one became infamously violent. ""Riotous scenes at Yarra Bank"", headlines around the nation proclaimed, when a demonstration organized by the Women's Peace Army in the week before the 1916 referendum turned nasty and returned servicemen began to attack female speakers. Both conscription referendums ultimately failed. The Australian Dictionary of Biography contains profiles of 174 anti-conscriptionists, many of whom went to jail, including Vida Goldstein's compatriots Adela Pankhurst and Jennie Baines. Baines was imprisoned for refusing to pay the fine she was issued for flying a red flag at Yarra Bank in 1918. She is reputedly the first Australian prisoner to go on a hunger strike. Other protesters were deported. As historian Janet Butler reminds us: ""It does take a special kind of bravery to stand against the tide."" The enduring legacies of the first world war emanate beyond the battlefields of Gallipoli, manifested not only in the ""shattered Anzacs"" whose families bore the burden of care, but also in the class and sectarian divisions that shaped Australia's social and political relations in the 20th century. Lest we also forget that the democratic freedoms we hold dear today -- freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech — were won in battles fought on home soil by courageous women and men who sacrificed much, but are still accorded little recognition. Perhaps, by the 125th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, when we again celebrate our national liberation narratives, we will come to associate riverbanks, as well as beaches, with the potent ebb and flow of freedom.

Tom Richards, 25, was arrested yesterday morning in his home city of Swansea. After being held in a cell for 11 hours, the cage fighter was bailed at 7pm as police continue their investigation. It comes after Westbrook, 41, made claims on social media that her younger former lover had been violent towards her, posting a photograph on Twitter of her bruised hand. The pair were last seen together at an Essex pub last month (above) after splitting up in November . It comes after the 41-year-old accused her younger former boyfriend of violence online. She was seen last month with a black-eye. Richards strenuously denies the allegations and has not been charged . Richards, who is an MMA fighter, has vehemently denied the allegations against him. The pair split in November last year after spending months together in California while Westbrook tried to rid herself of drugs. Speaking of his arrest yesterday, a spokesman for Richards said there was 'no truth' behind the allegations. 'There is no truth in these allegations and we will be challenging them.' The couple split in November after spending months together in California . Police arrested Richards in Swansea yesterday morning on suspicion of physically attacking his former girlfriend in Essex. While denying ever harassing or harming his former girlfriend, a spokesman added being arrested had been 'upsetting' for Richards. 'He is training for a fight and could do without the distraction. Due to the seriousness of these allegations that’s all we can say at the moment.' Taking to Twitter after being released, he wrote: 'Finally getting into bed after such a long day, cheers for all messages will reply tmz on here and other social media,#TeamBabyBoy (sic).' It is the second time Richards has faced legal action over allegedly abusing his former girlfriend. He was previously arrested over claims he gave the mother-of-two a black eye. Police later dropped the case against him. The claims of harassment involve alleged text messages and phone calls made to the blonde soap star. Westbrook has not spoken publicly of the most recent allegations. The actress, who was last year spotted at her local job centre collecting leaflets on childcare, is understood to be on holiday with her children. She and Richards became an item after the former EastEnders starlet parted ways with her husband of 12 years. They were last seen together in March when they met at an Essex pub.

The film, 'Child 44', starring Tom Hardy, Vincent Cassel and Gary Oldman, tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in the Stalin era. It is based on a novel by British writer Tom Rob Smith and was due to premiere in Russia today. Scroll down for video . Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Child 44, starring Gary Oldman (left) and Tom Hardy . The Hollywood blockbuster tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in Stalin era Russia . Russia's culture ministry said the film distorted history as it celebrated its victory over Nazi Germany . Russia's culture ministry said the film's distributors in Russia, Central Partnership, had agreed to withdraw a request for a distribution licence after ministry officials viewed the film. 'Films such as 'Child 44' should not go out in our country on mass release, earning money from our cinema audiences, not in the year of the 70th anniversary of victory, not ever,' Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky wrote on the ministry's website. The move to effectively ban a major mainstream Hollywood film just a day before it was due to premiere is unprecedented. In recent years, Russia has cracked down harshly on negative depictions of the Soviet Union during the Stalin era, while criticism of those who fought in the Second World War is taboo. The culture ministry accused the film of 'distortion of historical facts and the idiosyncratic treatment of events before, during and after' the war. The film is set in 1952, a year before Stalin's death, and features a maverick investigator seeking a serial killer, while hindered by official attitudes that such murders are not possible in the Soviet Union. Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky (pictured) condemned the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime . 'You realise murder is strictly a capitalist disease,' French star Cassel hisses in a thick Russian accent in the film's English-language trailer. Culture minister Medinsky slammed the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime and said it misrepresented a country that was 'one of the world leaders'. The film shows Soviet Army officers as 'blood-thirsty ghouls' randomly shooting people, 'especially gays,' Medinsky complained. Soviet women have to offer them sexual favours or 'be sent, as is customary, to the Gulag,' he added with heavy irony. The decision to pull the film came after the culture ministry on Tuesday gave it a distribution licence with an 18+ certificate. The head of Central Partnership, Pavel Stepanov, issued a statement saying he was 'satisfied' with the film's ban. 'We consider it's important in the future to increase state control over distribution of films that have a socially significant context,' he said. On Tuesday, Kultura state-funded arts newspaper, whose editor is a member of President Vladimir Putin's arts council, published a review of the film titled '44 shades of vileness.' 'Daniel Espinosa's film is made up of lies and spitting at Russia and Russians,' it wrote. Earlier this year the outspoken culture minister voiced his dislike of Russian art-house film 'Leviathan,' despite its landmark victory at the Golden Globes and Oscar nomination, complaining it was full of 'existentialist hopelessness.' Last month he sacked the head of a theatre in Siberia after its radical staging of a Wagner opera including images of Jesus Christ angered some Orthodox believers.","Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Hollywood's Child 44 .

The husband of billionaire heiress Tamara Ecclestone earned just £65 a week from his firm last year, it was revealed today. Jay Rutland, 34, who is married to the 30-year-old daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, saw his company bring in just £3,378 over the 12 months to July 2014. The training consultant’s firm Brigante Business Developments, based in Battersea, south-west London, is listed in company records as providing ‘management consultancy activities’. Its latest accounts for the year to July 2014 were filed to Companies House a fortnight ago, showing the company - which was incorporated in July 2012 - having total net assets of £3,378, down from £18,131 the year before. The former stockbroker - who lives with his wife and daughter Sophia, one, in a £45million house in west London - married the heiress in a £7million wedding in France in July 2013. The couple, who met in January 2013 and were engaged a month later, celebrated Sophia’s first birthday last month with a farmyard-themed party that cost an estimated £70,000. This included ponies, a zebra, a balloon house and even a magical princess. And last year Sophia enjoyed a private visit from Father Christmas and a replica electric Bentley car toy. Miss Ecclestone’s family is worth an estimated £3billion - and the couple are said to own a £300,000 Ferrari, £123,000 Bentley GT Continental and a £100,000 Range Rover. Family life: The former stockbroker lives with his wife and one-year-old daughter Sophia (pictured) in London . Company: Brigante Business Developments is based in this building (above) in Battersea, south-west London . A spokesman told The Sun yesterday: ‘Although this company is still active it had not been trading in the financial year the filing reflects.’ Mr Rutland's high-earning career in the City of London ended in shame in 2012, when he was banned from trading over 'market abuse'. In a damning ruling, the Financial Services Authority concluded he was not a 'fit and proper person' and his behaviour demonstrated a lack of 'honesty and integrity'. In 2013 Mr Rutland needed treatment for facial cuts after he was ambushed by two men in a mugging when he stopped his black Ferrari - just a month after marrying Miss Ecclestone. He was robbed of a £50,000 Rolex and a £20,000 bracelet by at least two thugs in an attack caught on CCTV, but the high-profile prosecution of a suspect was dropped due to insufficient evidence. MailOnline has approached a representative of the Ecclestone family for comment on the accounts.","Jay Rutland, 34, is married to 30-year-old daughter of Bernie Ecclestone .

Adi Viveash's team will start as favourites in Nyon, Switzerland after their resounding 4-0 win over Roma in the semi-finals on Friday, a result which continued their free-scoring form in this competition. Ahead of the final, we bring you everything you need to know. Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke starred in his side's emphatic 4-0 semi-final win over Roma on Friday . Solanke has scored 11 UEFA Youth League games during Chelsea's route to the final in Nyon, Switzerland . REMIND ME, WHAT IS THE UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE? In a nutshell, it's the Champions League - but for Under 19 teams. In its second season, the Youth League was created by UEFA to enable up-and-coming players in Europe's leading academies to gain valuable experience of playing in continental competition. The group phase runs in parallel with its big brother, with the same 32 teams as in the Champions League matched in the same groups. The main difference is that the knockout rounds are single-legged and the semi-finals and final in the same place over the course of one weekend. SO, WHERE IS THAT? Monday's final will be played at the Stade Colovray, which is situated in the shadow of UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. It's a pleasant spot, overlooking Lake Geneva, and is the home of Stade Nyonnais, who play in the Swiss third tier. It's capacity is 7,200 and pretty big crowds were there enjoying the sunshine and the football in Friday's semi-finals. WHEN IS THE GAME AND CAN I WATCH IT? It will kick-off at 3pm UK time and the match is live on British Eurosport. WHO WON THE COMPETITION LAST YEAR? The maiden winners of the Youth League were Barcelona, who defeated Benfica 3-0 in a one-sided final. The goals came from Rodrigo and a double from Munir El Haddadi, the competition's top goalscorer with 11 and now a member of the first-team squad. There was no English representation in the last four, though both Chelsea and Manchester City had made it to the quarter-finals. HOW HAVE THE BRITISH CLUBS DONE THIS YEAR? Chelsea, obviously, have made it all the way. Manchester City went out to Roma in the last eight, while both Arsenal and Liverpool tumbled out at the last 16 stage. Arsenal lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid and Liverpool were beaten 2-1 by Benfica. ALL HOPES WITH CHELSEA THEN? Yes, and they will enter Monday's match as the marginal favourites. It is well-established that the Stamford Bridge academy is one of the best in England and last season saw the Under 21 team claim the Premier League title and the Under 18s win the FA Youth Cup. They will take on Manchester City in this season's Youth Cup final, too, over the next couple of weeks, their fifth final in six seasons. Having missed out on the NextGen Series title to Aston Villa two years ago, this is an excellent opportunity to assert their claim as one of Europe's best academies too. Chelsea's Isaiah Brown (left) tussle for the ball with Roma's Silvio Anocic (right) in the box . WHO HAVE THEY BEATEN TO GET THIS FAR? The Blues made a statement of intent in the group phase, winning five of their six matches and racking up 24 goals in the process. Slovenians Maribor were beaten 2-0 at home and 7-0 away, while Sporting Lisbon suffered 5-0 and 6-0 drubbings. Germans Schalke, who knocked Chelsea out last season, were beaten 4-1 before managing to win 2-0 at home. Chelsea then overcame Russians Zenit St Petersburg 3-1 in the last 16 courtesy of goals from Dominic Solanke, Kasey Palmer and Charlie Colkett. Atletico Madrid were then seen off 2-0 at Cobham in the quarters, with an own goal and another from Solanke securing their passage to Switzerland. But their most impressive performance came in the semi-final with Roma on Friday as a flurry of second-half goals from Colkett, Solanke (2) and Tammy Abraham left Roma in ruins. Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek (right) and Roma's Jose Machin (left) battle for the ball on Monday . WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? Coach Viveash was effusive about his team's qualities after their drubbing of Roma, telling Uefa.com: 'I'm very proud – proud of the players, proud of the staff who have worked very hard to get to this stage. When you see players perform like that it brings warmth to your heart. 'I feel very proud to work with that calibre of player and to watch them play is wonderful for everyone who works in our academy. They were excellent from minute one to minute 94 and thoroughly deserve their place in the final.' Tournament top scorer Solanke, who took his season's tally to 11 Youth League goals with a brace, added: 'I'm over the moon. We had quite a difficult journey yesterday because our flight was cancelled, so we had to get on with it today. It's amazing to reach the final. 'It's such a big tournament containing some of the best teams in the world. The level has gone up in the knockout games, but we've stepped things up as well and managed to reach the final.' WHO IS THE COACH? Adi Viveash is a former defender who played for Swindon Town, Walsall and Reading in the Football League during an 18-year playing career. He joined Chelsea's academy in 2008, starting with the Under 12 team and working his way up. In July 2011, he was appointed Under 18 coach and led the team to two FA Youth Cup triumphs in three seasons. Viveash stepped up to take charge of the under 21 team this season and doubles up to lead the under 19 side in the Youth League. MEET THE PLAYERS .

While being beautiful, fit and healthy is expected, it's all about a demand for the 'influencer' now. Thanks to the proliferation of social media, in order for modelling agencies to keep up with client demand, 'influencer' and 'blogger' divisions are now being added to their traditional model portfolio. General manager of Vivien's Models Catherine McGill told Daily Mail Australia that they launched an 'influencers' section two months ago because of the growing need to accommodate client demand for social media numbers. Scroll down for video . Influencer: Gigi Hadid is one of many in-demand models whose social media following is as much a draw card as her good looks for clients booking her on jobs . Self-made model: Mimi Elashiry turned her social media following into a modelling career . Big on Instagram: Elashiry has almost 700,000 followers . 'Our bookers  were giving me feedback that clients wanted models who might be blonde, beachy and had a high social media following,' she said. 'Now when we’re booking talent, in negotiation process, we talk about the girls numbers.' McGill says the average expectation of clients will range anywhere between 10,000 - 300,000 followers. 'It’s not hard and fast number, but 10,000 is the minimum number clients are asking for,' she said. 'So if models are getting up to that, they might get added to our 'Influencer' page.' Joseph Tenni of Chadwick Models told News.com.au that 'It’s not unusual for a client to ask “how many followers does she have?” before they ask what they look like.' Chic Management also started a 'blogger' management division two years ago. Of influencer: Prestigious model agency Vivien's has introduced an 'Influencer' page noting their models' social media stats . 'That line of just being a model is being blurred': Bloggers and influencers are now being snapped up by agencies capitalising on their following . General Manager Paul Thomas says it's now where all the money is being spent, with clients seeking hard and fast brand promotion. 'If you  think about it, your brand can send their product straight to someone's pocket rather than printing a catalogue in store and waiting for a customer go collect it.' Thomas told Daily Mail Australia it's all about the elusive 'cool girl' appeal. 'Influencers are like a captain of the ship - because there is so much information out there, people turn to models, fashion people and talent and begin liking what they are liking.' 'We do have clients that  book in a traditional sense, but new up-and-coming brands want a ‘cool girl’ with vast social numbers that they can book a campaign off the back of the model's social media,' he said. It's this combination of 'cool girl' meets followers and a 'lust-have' lifestyle that Thomas said is really drawing in clients, and models are now being trained how to self-promote on their Instagram to get work. International: American Alexis Ren has over 1.6million followers, and is in demand Down Under as much for her looks as her army of followers . 'Now that line of just being a model is being blurred, people want to know about the model but it's got to be organic, you can smell when it’s all a bit too staged,' he said. Thomas said health and fitness is very 'on brand' at the moment, so that's something the girls are encouraged to promote, which most of them naturally will as they stay in shape. 'With new faces we sit down with them and do social media training, to make sure those girls are representing us as well. We don’t need them to be serious posters, just once or twice a day, or one every day.' Chic manage American model Alexis Ren, who has over 1.6 million followers and has shot previous campaigns for Australian label General Pants. 'She has 1.6 million followers, a  huge following in Australia, her boyfriend is this amazingly good looking surfie and her Instagram is a mood board that makes you want to be on holidays with them.' Thomas said it's a coup for Australian brands because she is not only 5’8, beautiful and blonde  but  she is 'insta-famous', has an increase of 45,000 followers per week and has a boyfriend with almost a million followers, so they have the tools they need to sell her as a talent. Chic Management also says bloggers like Sarah Donaldson from Harper and Harley and Brooke Testoni have scored major campaigns with Oral B and Pandora  based on their social outreach and style.","Australian model agencies reveal new demand for social media following .

161,08e3fd0d40d2287a094c2bce1a83d72344ad0b5d,"A selection of thirsty animals were captured drinking water in their own unique way – and the results are hilarious. Elad Hershkowitz, a zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, placed a GoPro camera at the bottom of water troughs to capture the different perspectives. The animals – ranging from a rhino who almost kisses the surface of the water to a lemur who delicately licks it – were recorded for a total of 30 hours. Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz, of the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, filmed animals drinking on a GoPro camera . He placed the camera in the animals' water troughs and filmed them  for a total of 30 hours . The 26-year-old then cut the final footage down to four minutes. He said: ‘Capturing this footage was really special. It offers a completely unique perspective to anything I’ve ever seen before. ‘I had the idea whilst walking around the enclosures and I saw the zebras drinking. ‘It made me curious to see what was going on below so I decided to check how the rest of the animals drink. Hershkowitz said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs . A commanding rhino appears to almost kiss the surface of the water after it purses its lips and takes a drink . ‘There is a massive difference in how each animal drinks. Carnivores, like lions, drink a lot like domesticated cats and dogs. Herbivores like the rhinos and zebras suck up the water with their lips.’ According to Mr Hershkowitz, some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object placed at the bottom of their trough. He said they attempted to check them out by putting their hooves and paws into the water first before going to take a drink. Eventually however, they got used to the camera’s presence and drank freely. A lemur is featured in the four minute footage and delicately licks the surface of the water with its tongue . A herd of zebra humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping the water from their trough . The zookeeper also anticipated a range of reactions from the animals before the experiment and ensured that the camera was secure before it took place. ‘I was really worried the lions would bite off the GoPro, so I placed a sheet of acrylic glass above the camera,’ he said. In the clip the lion can be seen aggressively breaking the surface of the water with its tongue, and is in complete contrast to a herd of zebra, who humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping.","A zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv recorded the footage .

The Serbian world number one has been an unstoppable force in recent weeks, winning 17 matches on the bounce and becoming the first man to win the season's first three Masters title. He comfortably beat Nadal on his beloved red clay in last week's Monte Carlo Masters semi-finals, and the nature of Djokovic's 6-3 6-3 mauling means plenty are backing him to complete his collection of grand slam titles this year by winning his first French Open. Rafa Nadal practices in Barcelona as he steps up his clay-court preparation ahead of the French Open . Nadal was beaten convincingly by Novak Djokovic in MOnet Carlo last week . But as far as Nadal is concerned, 2015 is no different to 2013, 2012 or even 2011. 'Djokovic was good in 2011, in 2012, 2013 as well as in 2015. Sometimes you win more and some you win less,' Nadal, who has triumphed at the French Open in nine of the last 10 years, told reporters at the Barcelona Open.

The ex Bon Jovi guitarist, 55, allegedly told former business partner Nikki Lund he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her', Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. Sambora is said to have made the chilling threat during a blazing telephone argument on March 19. His shaken former flame decided to report the allegation to authorities a week later. Police in the wealthy Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a 'person of interest' in an active investigation into criminal threats. Scroll down for video . Everything was rosy between the ex Bon Jovi guitarist and his lover and business partner Nikki Lund last July. But Lund has claimed in a statement to police that Sambora recently threatened her saying he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her,' Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. The rock star is believed to be on vacation in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and daughter Ava but faces questioning when he returns. Lund, 33, founded the Nikki Rich clothing line with Sambora and confessed last year that the pair had been having an on-off personal relationship for eight years. When their affair ended it plunged the business partnership into turmoil, just as the duo were preparing to open a boutique on swank Robertson Boulevard. Sambora's alleged threat came just days after Lund launched her first signature solo show at the opening of LA fashion week on March 18. 'They are in the midst of unraveling their fashion business Nikki Rich,' a source told Daily Mail Online. 'Things have become very bitter in recent weeks. 'The threat happened in the midst of Nikki launching her solo line. Richie apparently went mad on the phone at her and threatened to kill her. 'He said words to the effect that he was going to dig a hole in the desert and bury her.' Nikki, a close childhood friend of Kim Kardashian, filed a report Wednesday night with detectives from the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station. Back to back: The couple posed for the cover of the new edition of  LA Fashion Magazine before they went their separate ways . 'She held off going to cops hoping that the situation would resolve itself,' added the source. But after advice from lawyers and business associates she made the report. 'Richie has been drinking heavily for months and acting erratically . 'He has threatened violence in the past.' Nikki and Kim K are friends from way back . Lieutenant Jennifer Seetoo confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a person of interest in the case. Under Californian law making criminal threats can be a felony offence punishable by up to four years in jail. 'A report was taken regarding criminal threats,' Lieutenant Seetoo said. 'It's an active investigation.' A representative of Mr. Sambora said there was no truth in Nikki Lund's claims. 'This is a cluster of fabricated lies in retaliation for Mr Sambora's decision to cease further funding of the unprofitable partnership, plain and simple,' said the rep. Sambora suddenly quit Bon Jovi during their 2013 world tour because of 'personal issues'. The New York Post later reported that Jon Bon Jovi had kicked out his longtime songwriting partner due to substance abuse issues. Sambora and Lund reportedly began their romance in 2006 - a year before his divorce from Dynasty actress Locklear was finalized. Denise Richards dated Sambora . Sambora is believed to be in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and their daughter Ava . They are said to have carried on seeing each other despite Sambora going on to date another Hollywood beauty, Denise Richards. The long-time fling became public last December when Lund was doing publicity for the new fashion line. The curvy blonde confessed to Playboy TV: 'He's amazing in bed ... how could you stay away from the guy?' Their joint venture collapsed at the last moment, however, despite the pair appearing on billboards together and on the cover of Los Angeles Fashion magazine. Sambora is now dating Australian guitarist Orianthi despite a 26-year age difference. Lund's attorney declined to comment on the complaint.

Five young men were arrested Saturday in Melbourne, Australia, in what police called a major counterterrorism operation. Two of the teens, 18 and 19, have been released ""pending further inquiries,"" Australia's Federal Police said. Sevdet Besim, 18, was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act, and was denied bail Saturday. The person charged Monday is accused of conspiring to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts. The suspects planned to attack during a major national commemoration in a week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Saturday. ""The act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers,"" he said. There was also a risk to the public, police said. Police said the suspects were targeting a ceremony on Anzac Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps Day), which is April 25 and this year is the centennial of the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I. Abbott avoided the term ISIS -- or Islamic State -- to call out those who authorities believed influenced the suspects. He instead referred to the group as the ""Daesh death cult,"" employing the acronym that is transliterated from the group's name in Arabic. It's a handle ISIS is known to loathe. Police also distanced the suspects from any ethnic connection. The men ""are individuals acting by themselves. They are not representatives of any religious, cultural or national group,"" Victoria Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said. ""I think the entire Australian community should be concerned about the young age of those particular men,"" Neil Gaughan, acting deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, said.

Joelison Fernandes da Silva, 28, developed gigantism as a child and his rapidly soaring height forced him to drop out of school due to bullying and then refuse to leave the family house for years. But true  happiness eventually found the shy Brazilian - who has come to be known as 'the gentle giant' - in the form of Evem Medeiros, a 5ft 21-year-old woman he met online. Scroll down for video . Half his size: Joelison Fernandes da Silva, 28 (right), who at 7ft 8in tall has come to be known as 'the gentle giant', married Evem Medeiros (left), a 5ft 21-year-old woman he met online . 'The first time I saw her it was love at first sight,' Joelison said. 'I was charmed by her. I wanted to be with her all the time. It didn't matter about her size.' The former gold miner admits their huge height difference has left a few people bewildered, especially when it comes to the dynamics of their love-life. 'I get asked a lot about this and at first it annoyed me but nowadays it's normal and I am used to it. I take it in good humour,' explained the real-life Goliath. 'Some people like to talk about my shoe size and then imagine how big my member might be. 'I think the size of my feet is false advertising. Our love life is normal. We adapt. Lying down everyone is my size.' Happier times: Joelison developed gigantism as a child and his rapidly soaring height forced him to drop out of school due to bullying and then refuse to leave the family house for year . Joelison grew up in a small rural village in Paraiba, northern Brazil and was bullied from a young age due to his height. He got in trouble for fighting his tormentors and later decided to quit school altogether, much to the disappointment of his mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45. She said: 'From a young age I knew there was something not quite right with Joelison. 'When he was a baby and only a few months old the baby shoes stopped fitting his feet properly and I'd always have to go and buy more and more. 'I thought ""there’s something wrong here"" but the doctors said he was just a big baby and would stop growing eventually and so we waited for him to stop growing - but he still hasn’t stopped. True love: 'The first time I saw her it was love at first sight,' Joelison said. 'I was charmed by her. I wanted to be with her all the time. It didn't matter about her size' Joelison's mother added: 'When he got to eight years old I knew he was growing at an abnormal rate and by the time he was 14 he was already 6ft 4in. 'We lived in the rural zone and nobody knew him. For half of his life he had been hidden away. If anyone came to our house he was so shy he would hide so they wouldn’t see him. 'I was really worried.' Doctors later discovered he had a benign tumour on his pituitary gland that was causing his body to produce uncontrolled amounts of growth hormone. Joelison initially refused to have it removed as he didn't want to spend three months in hospital recovering, even though he was warned it would eventually kill him. But in 2007, after some convincing from his family, he agreed and had it removed using less invasive laser surgery performed through his nose. The successful operation helped slow his growth but he still sprouted another four inches to his current height of 7ft 8in. Long and the short of it: The former gold miner admits their huge height difference has left a few people bewildered, especially when it comes to the dynamics of their love-life, which he says they have 'adapted to' With the gigantism under control, Joelison's confidence grew. The computer games fan finally took a step into the public conscience and was eventually crowned Brazil's tallest man. One TV show took such pity on his plight they made him seven pairs of shoes to fit his enormous size 23 shoe size and custom shirts and shorts to fit his bulky frame. Joelison, who used to work in a gold mine as well as a plantation before leaving due to his health issues, now makes a living appearing in commercials for frozen ready meals. As a celebrity in his homeland he began to attract admirers, including new wife Evem. She contacted him on Facebook to wish him happy birthday and they swapped numbers before starting a committed relationship two months later. Mum: Joelison's mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45 (left), admits she's found it hard to adjust to her son's wife, claiming, 'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him' 'She was basically my first woman. The first woman of my life. I was 28,' said Joelison. 'I thought everything about her was beautiful - but especially her eyes. 'She is very caring. She doesn't show it when the cameras are here but she is caring and truthful. She has never lied to me.' Just a year later they were married and it didn't take them long to start trying for a family. But Evem, who hopes to find work as a hair stylist, was initially wary of getting intimate. 'I had a certain amount of fear,' she said. 'I was afraid it wouldn't work out. But it was fine. We have a normal love life.' She added: 'We want to have a family so I track my dates, times, temperature, everything. All I have to do is call him and he understands what is going on. 'I have polycystic ovaries and so there are months that I don't ovulate. I've done my exams and already know that my condition makes it more difficult to get pregnant. 'But he hasn't done his tests so we need him to go and do it so we can see if the problem really is just me.' Joelison and Evem are currently trying to start a family, but having difficulty due to Evem's polycystic ovaries . Aside from family planning they also struggle to work together on basic chores like cooking, cleaning and shopping as Joelison's height makes it tough for him to stand up for long periods of time. His new relationship has also caused friction with his mother, who is finding it hard to let him have his independence after 28 years. She said: 'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him and when I had to share him with someone else it really wasn’t easy. But as a mother I want him to be happy. 'With his treatment, I’m still the one who takes care of that, I haven’t delegated it to that girl yet. 'But I will once she gets used to things.' Joelison still has monthly injections and four types of daily medication to control his condition and is likely to need even more care as he gets older. However, he has still plans to fulfil many of his dreams, including having a family and travelling abroad. He also finally finished his high-school education last year after studying at home. On top of this, he is soon due to fly to a Paris convention where he will meet others with gigantism, including the tallest man in the world, Sultan Kösen from Turkey. And Joelison, who is thought to be the third tallest man in the world, says he is looking forward to the novelty of being smaller than someone for once. 'The most interesting thing is going to be standing face to face with someone,' he said. 'The last time I did that I was a child.'

The chairman of the BBC Trust will quit her role as a director at HSBC, it was reported last night. Rona Fairhead was last month accused of being either ‘incredibly naive or totally incompetent’ by Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, over her handling of a tax evasion scandal at the bank’s Swiss division. Now, the 53-year-old has told shareholders she will stay on for ‘a further one-year period’ before leaving the bank’s board entirely, according to The Times. She announced her departure in a letter to shareholders dated on March 20. It marks a change in position for the bank, which said in its annual report that Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She had been on the board since 2004. Last night, HSBC insisted that ‘no decision has been taken at this time’. In a bruising encounter, Labour MP Mrs Hodge had told the BBC chief: ‘You should think about resigning. If not, the Government should sack you.’ Mrs Fairhead chaired HSBC’s audit committee and then its risk committee while its Swiss clients are said to have dodged tax. The bank was subsequently fined £1.2 billion for breaching American money-laundering laws. Last year, Mrs Fairhead earned more than £500,000 last year as chairwoman of HSBC’s American business. Her decision marks a change from February, when HSBC’s annual report said that despite having been on the board since 2004, Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She was appionted to her role as chairwoman of the BBC Trust in October last year for a five-year term. Mrs Fairhead suggested that ‘frontline’ staff should bear responsibility for breaching the bank’s policies, during her grilling by the public accounts committee. She said: ‘We were horrified when we discovered (what happened). I can assure you absolutely no evidence of tax evasion was received. I could only respond to evidence that I had and I could only deal with that.’ But Mrs Hodge responded that to ‘simply take the evidence and not question. . . would mean she is not fit for purpose’. Under fire: Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee (left), called on Fairhead to quit or be sacked from BBC role over her HSBC role . Her likely departure from HSBC comes as the bank is planning for a wider clearout of non-executives who have been on the board for a long period of time.","Criticised over 'incompetent' handling of bank's tax evasion scandal .

'She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers. We expect that from her, and I expect that from her. 'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn’t make me think she will rebound from this. But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy.' Online petitions for McHenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released.

At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments.

'The main concerns raised have been over the potential of fans deciding to 'black up'. 'We have subsequently followed up on the complaints by contacting both Hartlepool United and Carlisle United on the matter. 'We clearly outlined that 'blacking up' has historically been a way of acting out racist stereotypes, and while the theme planned by fans may be well intended and chosen as part of an annual fancy dress tradition, such behaviour, if it occurs, is likely to cause offence.

He was unhappy, to put it mildly, that Lewis Buxton was cleared of fouling Callum Wilson in the second half, telling a radio station: ‘It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said, “Don’t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don’t want them to have any more”.’ Kieran Lee (second right) celebrates with his team after his 36th minute header put the visitors ahead . He toned down his sentiments by the time he met the written press and that is probably for the best. Howe is a good and rational man; certainly one of the most upwardly mobile and promising of all English coaches. A sign of the pressure of this incredible promotion race, then? Who could blame him if it was? Middlesbrough had beaten Norwich on Friday night to take Bournemouth’s place at the top and at 3.36pm on Saturday Kieran Lee put Wednesday in front. When Craig Cathcart scored a magnificent volley for Watford against Birmingham — the only goal of the match — Watford were top and Bournemouth were third. The natives grew restless. Then Yann Kermorgant equalised, lifting Bournemouth back up to second, and a home fan screamed into a camcorder held by a policeman. Senses take leave at this time of a season, which might also explain how Simon Francis quickly landed himself a second yellow card. Maguire turned to the home fans and motioned for them to dry their eyes. Alas, Matt Ritchie then hit the top corner and put Bournemouth top again but in stoppage time Adam Smith fouled Atdhe Nuhiu for a penalty. ‘No-one will blame Adam,’ Howe said. ‘We will tell him how much we love him tonight.’ Yann Kermorgant (second left equalises for the Cherries with 20 minutes of the contest remaining . Bournemouth's Simon Francis is dismissed by referee Paul Tierney in the 78th minute . Which is nice, though Maguire did score the penalty and Bournemouth did fall. Again. Howe said he felt ‘heartbroken’. Over the course of two spells at Bournemouth he has led them from League Two to this precipice, occasionally spending his own money in the darker days when the club was broke. Today, in their tiny stadium where parking costs £1 and stewards are encouraged to say hello, they are so close to something incredible. Tommy Elphick, Bournemouth’s captain, gave something of an insight into what his manager has been going through. ‘He is probably the first one every day in at 6 or 7 and probably leaving at 6 or 7 at night and the players follow suit,’ he said. ‘We realise how much he does for us. When a single person gives that much of their life towards you, you only want to repay them.’ But the best intentions can only do so much in a race like this. Promotion is worth somewhere in the region of £120million and, as of the weekend, eight teams are in the hunt for three spots. Multiple narratives, multiple charges and multiple futures on the line. It’s crazy but it’s brilliant. With only two games to play it has been a magnificent race up the hill. Matt Ritchie races away to celebrate after his 85th minute free kick put the home side ahead for the first time .","Bournemouth are now second in the Championship following their draw .

172,691bac0b53a908837ea2ef0d2d7c5c4e5c3a43d2,"A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, ""Wow!""' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.","Skin Laundry, a trendy new skin clinic in Manhattan, offers a ten-minute laser facial which promises to tighten skin .

And the German star says his injury has actually helped him, claiming that it 'worked in my favour' after a busy schedule.

'At the moment I am pleased with the consistency of my game,' Ozil told Sport magazine. 'I feel I am now playing my best football since joining Arsenal.' The playmaker was a big part of Germany's World Cup win over the summer, playing every game as Joachim Low's side lifted the trophy in Brazil, and the process took a lot out of him.

174,dd7200d8975b2f30512d4b813b123b8d54330b47,"A former mob enforcer in Rhode Island with ties to late New England crime boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca has died in a federal prison in North Carolina. Gerard T. 'The Frenchman' Ouimette was 75. The Federal Bureau of Prison's website reported that Ouimette, who had lived in Fall River, Massachusetts, died Sunday. Ouimette, suspected of having a role in up to eight murders, 'ran' the federal prison in North Carolina in the 1970s and even had booze, drugs and lobster dinner smuggled in on a weekly basis, according to a Rhode Island State Police report. His nephew, Kevin Ouimette Lynch, tells the Providence Journal that his uncle was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and died in his sleep at a prison in Butner, North Carolina. Ouimette was reportedly in control of a gangster network responsible for gambling, loansharking, extortion, and murder, among other crimes . Ouimette passed away in this medium security facility after being diagnosed with lung cancer . In 1996, Ouimette was convicted of extortion and became the first criminal in New England sentenced to life in prison under the federal 'three strikes and you're out' provision for violent offenders. Ouimette had more than 10 convictions during his criminal career, including one for punching an FBI agent. The Providence Journal reports that Ouimette spent a total of 46 years behind bars. A 1979 FBI document regarding his background paints the picture of man in control of a massive underworld network. 'Subject OUIMETTE controls a large group of criminals known as the OUIMETTE faction, whose criminal activities include gambling, loansharking, extortion and property violations such as major hijackings, robberies and burglaries,' the report states. Ouimette had close ties to crime boss Raymond Patriarca, seen here leaving a federal building in Boston on June 27, 1967. 'Although not Italian, OUIMETTE enjoys the same stature as lieutenants under RAYMOND L.S. PATRIARCA, who controls organized crime (OC) in the Boston and New England area.' The document went on to call Ouimette responsible for 'seven of eight gangland-style murders.' He was never convicted of any homicides, however. Ouimette was known to his associates as 'The Frenchman.' In his 2012 memoir, 'What Price Providence,' the enforcer blamed the police for the nickname. ''The Frenchman' is the name that Rhode Island police attached to me in 1969 since I am proud of my French descent, an anomaly in that neighborhood,' he wrote. 'Due to ensuing notoriety, the name stuck.' In the introduction to that back, he wrote that he knew he would die in prison. 'There is a saying that is appropriate to prison life: 'If you sit by the river long enough, you will eventually see all your enemies float by,'' he wrote. 'Bottom line is, if you can survive, you're ahead of the game, not by much, but by some. The reason is, there is no room for error when you are playing the La Costra Nostra's major leagues; one mistake can end your life, and often does.' The gangland enforcer's influence was not diminished behind bars, and state police said he even became the boss of the ACI's maxium security prison in the 1970s. At least once a week in the latter years of that decade, gang associate Charles 'The Ghost' Kennedy would visit the facility with as much as $600 worth of alcohol, marijuana, ham, cold cuts, cheese, and Italian bread for security guards to deliver to the incarcerated Ouimette and his gang. They even had catered lobster dinners, police said. Ouimette, then 55, is seen here being escorted out of Federal Court in Providence, Rhode Island, after being sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1996 . Besides booze, Ouimette even once had his son, then only five-years-old, smuggled into the prison for a sleepover, the Journal reported. Eventually he and Kennedy had a falling out, and Kennedy claimed a hit squad was assembled to kill him. A fearful man, during his 1996 exortion trial several strippers who were called to testify about threats Ouimette had made in their club broke down in tears before him in court. Ouimette's body will be sent back to Rhode Island where Ouimette will be buried.","Gerard T. Ouimette, 75, known as 'The Frenchman,' died in medium security federal pen in his sleep .

176,5bf656b9bc77d95d009faa17ea8cee6abf64b5d1,"Jamie Carragher says Mike Ashley has turned Newcastle United into a ‘boring’ club and has accused the billionaire owner of only being interested in making money. His words are sure to resonate with supporters who boycotted Sunday’s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs – a sixth straight loss which equals their worst-ever run in the Premier League. Before the game fans gathered outside the Gallowgate End and were united in choruses of ‘We’re rich but our team is s***’ and ‘Where’s the money gone?’ in protest at Ashley’s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of £18.7million and later revealed they have £34m sat in the bank. Mike Ashley has been accused of making Newcastle a 'boring' club because he only wants to make money . Carragher, too, is alarmed at what has become of Newcastle. ‘I can understand why fans are frustrated,’ said the Sportsmail columnist in his punditry role on Sky Sports. ‘It’s getting to the stage now, football is so big and there’s that much money coming in to the game with the new TV deal, I am sick of owners coming in who are successful business people wherever they’ve been. They think “Where else can I make money? Oh a football club”. ‘I’ve had it at my own club Liverpool with George Gillett and Tom Hicks and it’s the same at Newcastle. Jamie Carragher slammed the chairman and says he's alarmed at the state Newcastle are currently in . ‘People will say as supporters you’ve got to come back, you’ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters? ‘Since Mike Ashley’s been here they’ve been relegated once and they could be relegated once again. ‘So he’s balanced the books - he’s made money because he’s a businessman - but I think of these people and wonder, “Don’t you want to be excited yourself?”. ‘I’m getting bored by Newcastle. When you watched them over the years there was madness, there was excitement, stupid goals going in one end and then the other, but it was exciting. ‘Now it’s boring. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there’s nothing happening? There’s no cup run, I just don’t get it. I don’t get why he wants to own a football club.’ Meanwhile, former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn says Ashley must try to reconnect with the club’s fans. Thousands of fans chose to boycott the Tottenham game in protest of Mike Ashley's tenure at the club . Some fans that did go to St. James' Park showed their disgust in the stadium with banners and posters . There was blocks of empty seats where fans chose not to attend the 3-1 loss to the London side . ‘I think you’ve got to get the balance right. It’s not just about making money,’ he said. ‘Early on in his tenure here he was getting criticism and he made his mind up he was doing it his way and he didn’t care what the fans thought. And that is something that just doesn’t work. ‘Sunderland fans will resent me for saying this, but the Geordie fans have been through everything with this football club, and for them to stay away and not watch a game of football at this club - that hurts. It tells of the disconnect and it has to be resolved. ‘To reconnect has to be the best way forward.’ Thousands of posters were created by Ashleyout.com and passed around the city prior to the game .","Jamie Carragher has slammed Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley .

177,af607233559f42e897f7c8d5ef44cd112715d955,"Two men who claim they were molested as young boys by Michael Jackson are expected to find out on Tuesday if they will be allowed to sue  for a slice of the late King Of Pop's $1.5 billion estate. Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once the singer's staunchest defender, now claims Jackson was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff has scheduled a hearing for Robson and another of Jackson's alleged child victims, James Safechuck, on Tuesday that could decide if their respective claims proceed. Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once Michael Jackson's staunchest defender, now claims the singer was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child . Robson and Safechuck missed a statutory deadline when they filed their claims more than a year after Jackson's 2009 death. If Judge Beckloff gives Robson, 32, and Safechuck, 36, a green light to proceed with their civil claim, new child molestation allegations will likely be revealed in court against Jackson. Lawyers say the King Of Pop shelled out nearly $200 million to as many as 20 victims, reports the New York Post. The Jordan Chandler lawsuit alone is alleged to have cost more than $40 million. Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride. Safechuck alleges the singer gave him a marriage certificate and a wedding band as keepsakes and confirmation of their 'undying love'. He also alleges that Jackson wrote a check for more than $1 million to Safechuck's father, a sanitation worker. James Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride . 'Jackson was successful in his efforts to the point that my client endured repeated acts of sexual abuse of a heinous nature and was brainwashed... into believing they were acts of love and ­instigated by James himself,' Safechuck's attorneys said in the ­filings. The singer regularly dressed Safe­chuck in clothes identical to his and would tell reporters Safechuck was his cousin, a former employee said. Safechuck's attorney alleges that Jackson molested Safechuck more than 100 times. Robson was a five-year-old dance prodigy in Brisbane, Australia, when he first met the singer. Prior to filing his civil lawsuit in 2013 he had been one of the pop star's biggest supporters, including testifying under oath at Jackson's 2005 molestation trial in California he was never abused by Jackson. Robson was a key reason for Jackson's acquittal. He now says he 'lived in silence and denial for 22 years' and alleges he was seven years old when Jackson first molested him. Former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, left, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw them semi-nude in bed together . Robson accuses Jackson of first molesting him at the Neverland Ranch, while his sister slept in a separate bed just metres away. A former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw Jackson and Robson semi-nude in bed together, the Post reports. The estate has previously asked the court to reject the claims on the basis that Robson waited too long to file and because Jackson is the only other person with knowledge about the accusations and has been dead for more than five years. Robson, a choreographer for Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, says he has been unable to work because of the pain caused by Jackson's abuse. Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest.","Wade Robson and James Safechuck hope to find out on Tuesday if they can bring a civil lawsuit against the late singer's estate .

178,1ae7d8c3af1fa0b0a0a7d9fcb61b21336188ee8c,"A barrister and Oxford University graduate who spent more than two years avoiding paying for his train ticket could be the biggest fare-dodger to be prosecuted, a court heard. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over a two-and-a-half year period. He travelled from his Oxfordshire home to London Marylebone but pretended to have only gone from Wembley, in north west London. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over two-and-a-half years . Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year . The Australian-born lawyer argues that he only dodged up to £9,714.40 in fares, claiming the amount should be based on the cost of a weekly ticket, and take into account annual leave. But prosecutor Malachy Pakenham told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'If it is accepted that the loss was £23,000, this defendant would be convicted of the biggest rail evasion case that has come to the court in the United Kingdom. 'The Crown have reached that figure by a number of rail staff calculating it. 'The train company are experts, not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed, you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket, you calculate it on a full single fare, of the return for the day, each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket'. Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year. Barnett claimed to have travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire . The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. The Rhodes scholar claimed to have travelled from Wembley, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a £550,000 five-bedroom detached home. Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor. When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012. The lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children's charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at 'promoting prosperity'. A court heard how the barrister got off at London Marylebone (pictured) by tapping out with an Oyster card . It is understood he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket, and then getting off at Marylebone by simply tapping out with an Oyster card. Because there was no start point to his journey, the automated system charged him the maximum Transport for London fare, which is currently £7.60. But this is still far less than the £19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home. The case was adjourned until July 27 so a hearing can be held to determine the loss caused to Chiltern Railways. Barnett was released on unconditional bail. The deception places him among the ranks of Britain's biggest fare dodgers, closely behind a former millionaire fund manager. Jonathan Burrows was banned from working in the City last year after avoiding £43,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex. Burrows had hoped to keep his name out of the public eye and avoid prosecution by quickly reimbursing Southeastern trains the full amount in unpaid tickets, accrued over five years, within three days of being caught.","Peter Barnett, 43, travelled from Haddenham and Thame to Marylebone .

Cumnock resident Christine Weston says the Rent-a-farmhouse initiative she set up in 2008 brought new life to her town of 280 people near Orange The town's population increased 30 per cent but those families are growing up and moving on.

Scarlett's parents helped renovate the old 'Barina' homestead while renting the property for $1 a week . This farmhouse in Wycheproof, a wheat town  northwest of Melbourne, was leased for $1 a week in a bid to boost enrolments at the  local school and sports club . 'We offer $1 rent on the condition that the families who move in have kids, but can also contribute to bush communities with skills we’re short of,' Ms Weston said. Ms Weston says some farmhouses are being offered at  low rent because they need renovating. Others need a caretaker to look after the farm and some need skilled labour to help during busy harvest times and others need children to save the school bus run. Everyone is welcome to apply. The Mercer's country home called 'Barina' which is part of the Rentafarmhouse scheme . Cumnock was the first town to implement the Rentafarmhouse project but more than 20 rural communities from WA, Victoria, Tasmania and NSW have benefited from taking part in similar $1-a-week schemes. The sheep shearing town of Errowanbang, near Orange, saw its school enrolments increase 300 per cent after  residents started leasing properties to new families for next to nothing. In Rugby, 200kms south-west of Sydney, a school was saved. Its student  numbers had dwindled to two. Some of the $1-a-week farmhouses are rundown and in need of renovation, others need a caretaker for the farm or children in the community to keep local schools running .

In court: Robbie Knievel, pictured in court on Wednesday, was arrested for DUI in Montana after crashing into another car on Tuesday evening and setting off a chain-reaction crash involving two other cars . Officers noticed that he had a bloody lip and smelled of alcohol, but he refused to perform a breath test and so officers got a search warrant to take a blood sample, the Montana Standard reported. Knievel was booked into jail. On Wednesday, he made his initial appearance in Justice Court. He has been in the area, where he has family, for a couple of weeks, authorities said. Skuletich says Knievel invoked his rights to an attorney but didn't give officers a name. The son of the famous daredevil Evel Knievel has previously admitted to being an alcoholic and pleaded guilty to DUI in South Dakota in August 2013. Like father like son: Robbie is pictured jumping 21 Hummers at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2008 . Icon: American daredevil and entertainer Evel Knievel poses for a portrait before a stunt in 1976 . In that incident, he drove his vehicle into two motor homes as he left a campground and a blood-alcohol test suggested he was nearly three times the legal limit. He received a suspended jail sentence and paid nearly $600 in fines. His driver's license was also suspended for 30 days. Following the arrest, he spoke with 'TMZ Live' and admitted that he had an alcohol problem. 'I'm a frickin' drinking, driving daredevil,' he told the show. 'I ride motorcycles and I friggn' drink and ride … that's my deal.' They also asked him how he would feel if he hurt someone while he was behind the wheel. 'I shouldn't be drinking and driving 'cause I could kill somebody,' he said. 'And you know what, it would be better if I killed myself.' Together: The two Knievels are pictured together in 2006 - the year before Evel passed away, aged 69 . Knievel appeared in his father's stunts as a child and has continued working as a daredevil in his own right, while his older brother, Kelly, overseas the Knievel brand. Among his most famous stunts, Robbie Knievel, a father-of-two, jumped over the Grand Canyon in May 1999 - succeeding where his father had failed years earlier. To complete the jump, which was televised by Fox, he soared 228 feet (69 meters) across a narrow part of the canyon on his a 500 cc motorcycle. Evel Knievel, who famously jumped lines of cars and buses, and attempted to hurdle sharks, canyons and anything else, passed away in 2007, aged 69.","The daredevil, 52, 'was speeding in an SUV when he rear-ended a car and set off a chain-reaction crash involving two other vehicles on Tuesday'

Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year, when the flight disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The reports come as acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared . Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean . Despite an exhaustive search that is underway along a 600 square kilometre arc approximately 1800 kilometres southwest of Perth, locals from the island believe they identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, reported The Weekend Australian. Villagers from the community of 3500 claim that many on the island saw the passenger plane, and were interviewed by police and testified with signed statements to what they witnessed. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low. I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane', said Ahmed Shiyaam, 34, an IT manager. Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing. I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, ""I saw this strange plane"". This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here,' Mr Ibrahim said. The Maldvies National Defence Force released a statement in March last year which denied that there had been any aircrafts in the area at the time of the disappearance, which locals have branded as an attempt to hide the limitations of their radar facilities. A local media outlet reported that witnesses claimed the plane was travelling north to southeast, and that the plane was travelling so low it's doors could be seen. 'I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,' an eyewitness told the website. Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board . The search for the missing plane has been headed up by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre . The search has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia . 'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.' The plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. It was then tracked by Malaysia’s military radar heading towards the Indian Ocean. Over the past year, the search for the missing plane by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, headed by Australia, has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia. The location of the search was primarily calculated by sophisticated satellite technology which recorded 'pings' or 'electronic handshakes' sent between MH370 and a satellite for the final hours of it's journey. The flight made a number of unexplained deviations, and flew for several hours in radio silence after it lost contact with Air Traffic Control while flying between Malaysia and Vietnam. As of early March 40 per cent of the area had been scrutinised, but there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' said Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman.

Dr Alec Duncan (left) from Curtin University's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal . The signal was recorded west of Rottnest Island using acoustic recorders (above) at 1:30 am on March 8 . The reports from Kudahuvadhoo follow information released from Curtin University  that a 'clear acoustic signal' was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the plane's disappearance. Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. The Centre, along with United Nations’ Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and Geoscience Australia were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search, and originally determined that the noise's source was close to the Maldives and Kudahuvadhoo. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. An Indian sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight . Relatives of the missing passengers of flight MH370 visit a temple in China to pray for their family members . Relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that MH370 plunged into the sea on March 24, 2014 . 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. 'It would be more correct to say that our team has identified an approximate possible location for the origin of a noise that is probably of geological origin, but cannot be ruled out as being connected with the loss of MH370,' he told The Weekend Australian. In early March, Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said that data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months. 2014 . 2015 .","Locals from the Maldives island of Kudahuvadhoo claim they saw a low-flying jet on the morning MH370 disappeared .

182,cf38baea64d8984e49ae7964a9820dbd35effce8,"(CNN)It takes a village to raise a triathlete. Since returning home from our kickoff weekend where we got to experience life as a full-time triathlete, I've been juggling training life with a full-time job, hectic commute and time with friends and family. With my Fit Nation teammates spread far and wide, this was a solo effort. Throw in a notorious Chicago winter that refused to go gently into that good night, and I'll admit it: I was not very diligent in getting all of my training done. ""Partner up,"" the Facebook status read. Jae Rockwell, the founder of my local women's fitness groups, Women RUN the World, posted this mantra to help us keep ourselves accountable. And so that's what I did. I'm lucky to count a handful of both experienced and aspiring triathletes among my friends. So, I reached out to them to ask what they were up to. Annastasia W., who's training for her first Ironman half-triathlon this summer, suggested a group brick workout at our local gym. She invited several other women, including complete newbies, through the SoleTri Sisters Facebook group and 10 of us met up on a cold Chicago morning to swim for 15 minutes, bike for 30 minutes and run for 15 minutes. That was great motivation to keep up with my workouts for the next week. A few weeks later, I traveled to Little Rock, Arkansas, to run a marathon. I traveled to Little Rock with three phenomenal ""fitspirations"": Samantha Goga, Natali Villarruel and Umber Rahman -- who are members of an obstacle course race group called the Midwest Vikings. Seeing how much fun they've had participating in some really daunting physical challenges helped me push through some of the more difficult moments of running my first marathon! Swimming remains my weakest link. I just learned to swim last summer. Sometimes I forget that and don't cut myself any slack or recognize how far I've come. Once my formal swim class ended in February I found myself seriously slacking on my swim training. Enter my swim angels, Lovie Twine and Eanista Bailey. They took me out into Lake Michigan last year after my first swim class was complete for a celebratory ""swim"" (which was really just wading). It was great to have them join me for a swim workout. I appreciated their perspective and gentle coaching. And you know what was happening while I was partnering up? Spring was on the way! And that meant I could finally break free of my Computrainer bike sessions and hit the road. I was lucky enough to connect with the Major Taylor Cycling Club of Chicago (MTC3) for a series of novice rides they've been hosting on local trails around Chicagoland. With two falls behind me (hey, those clips take some getting used to), we got in nearly 23 miles and a new addiction was born. Riding outside with the wind whipping your face, chasing your friends and breathing fresh air is exhilarating and I'm looking forward to many more rides outdoors. I want to say thank you to the fellowship of fitness that I've been lucky enough to find. There are so many others we keep me inspired, accountable and motivated. I'm so grateful that they keep me moving in the right direction and I hope that I can help others do the same. So when times get tough, partner up!",Working out in a group of friends inspired Fit Nation participant Erica Moore .

The 23-year-old Serbian-born fashion star, who appears in a solo editorial in the May issue of Vogue, told the publication that she was advised not to undergo her gender reassignment surgery because it would transform her from an interesting enigma into just another pretty girl. Andreja noted that there were people who warned her not to transition, explaining: ‘There was definitely a lot of, ""Oh, you’re going to lose what’s special about you. You’re not going to be interesting anymore. There are loads of pretty girls out there.""' Scroll down for video . Fashion pioneer: Transgender model Andreja Pejic posed for photographer Patrick Demarchelier for a spread in Vogue. The 23-year-old revealed to the magazine that she is the new face of Make Up For Ever . Major debut: The model, who underwent gender-confirmation surgery last year, took to the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show in February (pictured) One agent even told her that 'it's better to be androgynous than a tranny', but Andreja refused to fall prey to those opinions. 'It is about showing that this is not just a gimmick,' she said of being transgender. Andreja also revealed during the interview that she has been signed as the newest face for beauty brand Make Up For Ever, and is thought to be the first ever transgender model to land a major cosmetics campaign. And her success is, she hopes, a sign that there is a cultural shift occurring within the industry when it comes to gender identity. 'There are just more categories now,' she told Vogue. 'It’s good. We’re finally figuring out that gender and sexuality are more complicated.' Andreja was born in what is now known as Bosnia-Herzegovina and later to emigrated to Melbourne, Australia. She grew up as a boy named Andrej, although she admitted that she was unsure where she fit in during her adolescence. She even considered being gay, but explains that even that 'didn't fit', saying: 'Society doesn’t tell you that you can be trans.' Andreja recalled wanting to 'stop puberty in its early tracks' because she was worried about her jawline becoming too strong and her feet and hands growing too large . Fashion friends: Andreja posted this picture of herself posing alongside Kendall Jenner while the pair were backstage at the Giles  show . Two worlds: Before her sex reassignment procedure, Andreja made a name for herself as both a male and female model, having modeled menswear (L) and womenswear (R) for Jean Paul Gaultier . But at 6'1, Andreja, who also wears a size 11 shoe, fits in perfectly with her fellow models. On her first modeling gig she looked around the room and told herself she didn't need to worry because 'every girl in fashion is exactly the same'. Before undergoing her sex reassignment surgery, Andreja made a name for herself within the fashion industry as both a male and a female model, with her androgynous look allowing her to showcase both male and female designs. She modeled Jean Paul Gaultier's Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2012 collection in Paris in July 2012, before going on to showcase the same designer's menswear range as part of Paris Fashion Week in January 2013. She took the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show show at London Fashion Week in February. And her new cosmetics campaign is just the latest means of her continuing to break boundaries – something which is already being echoed throughout the fashion industry by many other models. Last month, it was announced that transgender teen Jazz Jennings, 14, would be the new face of skincare brand Clean & Clear's new 'See The Real Me' campaign.

185,dfea7a09613642f43b58623e0557bfeb8fccc1bd,"(CNN)If there was ever any doubt that the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan is an energy policy plan, not a carbon reduction plan, all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy. Nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy, generating over 60% of our carbon-free electricity.   Surely President Barack Obama's climate plan, allegedly aimed at reducing the United States' overall carbon emissions, would revitalize the nuclear industry, lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets. Well, think again. James Hansen, the former head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in 2013 that ""continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change."" Yet Wednesday, the White House will celebrate Earth Day and promote its work to fend off climate change, while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration's favorite climate scientists. Despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free, the Obama administration's energy policy plan is biased against it.  This bias is created by how Environmental Protection Agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation.  EPA's modeling is divorced from reality. First, EPA's ""Base Case for the Proposed Clean Power Plan"" purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the Clean Power Plan.  This base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 2050. EPA's implementation modeling, ""Option 1 -- State,""  shows exactly the same situation: no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050.  In other words, EPA assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050. These assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets. A group of University of Tennessee graduate students made this point to EPA at a public hearing last summer. Using EPA's own data, the graduate students showed that EPA's energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants.  The students demonstrated that under this scenario, EPA's model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase. President Obama's EPA has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model. For example, when EPA modeled the Lieberman-Warner bill in 2008, the agency indicated 44 nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill. EPA's modeling of the 2009 Waxman-Markey bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation. Where did this policy shift come from? At a recent hearing in the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mary Nichols, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, told Congress that EPA looked at California's California Global Warming Solutions Act when developing its so-called Clean Power Plan and that EPA's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon-free. Thus, EPA is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon-free energy over others. Congress did not give EPA the authority to make these choices, so instead they have hidden them in the modeling. For example, the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and 2050.  This is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only 20 to 30 years before needing replacement. This anti-nuclear bias also is evident in Obama's recent executive order ""Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade,"" which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions. Even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon-free electricity, the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors. While I have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon, I believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security, and I have supported legislation that helps to clean the air. The administration says it shares these same interests, despite differing avenues to get there.  The administration also believes in man-driven global warming, which should make nuclear energy its golden key. But the Clean Power Plan and the President's recent executive order demonstrate that the Obama administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy. If you think this administration supports nuclear energy, think again.","U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe: Nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy, generating over 60% of our carbon-free electricity .
So why doesn't the President's climate plan, allegedly aimed at reducing carbon emissions, do more with nuclear power?"

Since announcing his intention to retire in February, McCoy has enjoyed a farewell tour up and down the country as well as travelling over to Ireland, with the attendance at usually mundane midweek meetings boosted by his presence. The adulation shown to him has made the 20-times champion jockey realise just how much he affected the lives of the racing fraternity but while the decision to quit seemed to some to come out of the blue, McCoy feels he owes it to his family to go out at the top. Tony McCoy holds the jockeys championship trophy he won for the 20th  time on the day he retires . Northern Irishman McCoy shows his emotion at Sandown Park after the final race of his career . McCoy says the response to his retirement announcement has made his final months in the saddle easier . Speaking to At The Races on the first morning he could no longer call himself a jockey he said: 'We had a very good night but I've just got up and haven't got round to eating breakfast yet. I can smell it, though, and someone has done the right thing and cooked me a nice breakfast. 'It was very difficult to take it all in yesterday, the crowd, the people round the parade ring, the great racing public came out in force and I was very flattered and honoured by it all. 'To get a reception like that for doing something I've loved to do for pretty much all my life, I'm really going to miss it. 'I told all the lads yesterday to enjoy it while you're doing it because the end comes quickly. 'It's very nice to feel that I have the respect of people up and down the country. For the last 21 years I've ridden up and down the country pretty much full on but over the last two and a half months people have come out to give me a wonderful welcome and I'm very grateful of that. 'It would be very difficult not to notice how that has developed and I'd like to thank all those people for coming out and making the last few months of my career so special and making it a little bit easier.

McCoy stands with his wife Chanelle and children Eve and Archie with the trophy he's won 20 times in a row .

McCoy said he had initially thought he could go quietly on his final day at Sandown but his agent Dave Roberts helped him come to the decision of making the announcement early and giving racing fans a chance to say their farewells. 'When I decided to retire I always thought I'd go to Sandown on the last day and say 'thanks very much' but having spoken to Dave, he said I was very privileged to be champion jockey for the 20th time and we kind of felt, for my own piece of mind, to do it like we did would help me come to terms with actually retiring,' he said. 'We also felt it might be a good thing for racing, people probably deserved to know. 'I thought it would die down but it never really did and those are things I'll remember for ever. When I looked around yesterday, as difficult as it was it helped me realise I'd made the right decision.' 'If I'd carried on and maybe not been as good as I was a lot of these people might not have come out. It's hard to say it but it is probably the right decision. 'I feel satisfied through what has happened with my life but I've also said I'd love another go because I feel I could still do it better than anybody! 'I never felt like I did a day's work in my life, I've felt a lot of satisfaction and fulfilment and I'm very proud of what I've been lucky enough to achieve but so many people have helped that happen, I was just the lucky one who got on the best horse most of the time. 'The owners, the trainers, the lads, the horses, I could go on all day thanking people. McCoy said he thought he could retire quietly but is glad he's had the chance to farewell racing properly . Sandown Park was packed out for the champion jockey's finale on Saturday in Esher . McCoy said there were 'a lot' of things he would miss about racing but also some aspects of the tough sport that he will be happy to see the back of. 'Like spending a lot of time in a hospital and ringing doctors begging for help to make me better,' he said. 'Obviously my wife Chanelle wanted me to retire but at the same time I knew myself it was the right time for my family, my mum and dad are in their 70s now and don't enjoy watching me as much any more because of the dangers involved so it certainly makes their life easier. 'I never thought of the dangers and when I got injured I felt I was unlucky and it wouldn't happen again but I know the dangers and they first became apparent to me when I was at Toby Balding's and Richard Davies died and just lately you only need to see what happened to John Thomas (McNamara) and Robbie McNamara.'","AP McCoy rode in his last races on Saturday at Sandown Park .

Not knowing when the car might burst into full flame, they scrambled to save her, while a police dash cam rolled. CNN obtained the footage from affiliate WPIX. Kinnelon Police Officers Mark Ehrenburg and Ricky Ferriola cut the seat belt from her, then dragged the woman's limp body away from the crash to start emergency medical care. Not a minute later, flames licked out of the car. Two more minutes -- an explosion. All three were lucky to escape the flames. The rescue started when someone reported an erratic driver on Thursday, and the officers sped off to investigate. When they pulled up at the scene, the 2006 Toyota Solara convertible was already a smoking wreck. Its horn was blaring. The officers ran over to the flipped over car, and shouted over the honking horn at the driver, ""Can you hear me?"" No response, not even a gesture, the video showed. It took them two minutes to cut off the seat belt, as smoke kept rising. Once they had her in safety, the officers hooked the driver up to a defibrillator and started CPR. The woman, identified by the Kinnelon Police Department as Dawn Milosky, 45, of Beachwood, New Jersey, was airlifted to Morristown Medical Center and survived. She's been charged with driving while intoxicated, having an open container of alcohol in the vehicle, reckless driving and with failure to stay in her lane, according to WPIX. Kinnelon Police Sgt. Chris Carbone told WPIX that they released the video to show that the driver may have died, if others had not informed the police. As for his colleagues' bravery, he said, ""A lot of times, we don't think of our own safety doing this job.""

He was the one German leader in the Second World War who the British regarded with honour. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel gained respect from his foes for his tactical acumen and sense of fairness during the battle for North Africa. Rommel, nicknamed the Desert Fox, also became an iconic wartime figure – and the stylish goggles he famously wore across his peak cap became part of the myth. Now the story of how the German came to be in possession of the goggles can be told for the first time. They were given to him by a British prisoner as a gift to thank him for retrieving a stolen hat. Major General Michael Gambier-Parry, of the 2nd Armoured Division, was captured with 2,000 of his men by Rommel in Mechili, Libya, in 1941. The German field marshal invited the British officer to dine with him in a gesture of military camaraderie. The pair shared good wine and smoked ‘excellent cigars’, according to Gambier-Parry’s granddaughter, Liza Donoghue, 67. During the meal, Gambier-Parry complained that a German soldier had taken his hat. A furious Rommel then took it upon himself to get the garment back to his prisoner. And when Rommel later found Gambier-Parry’s Army goggles in a staff car, he asked the British officer if he could keep them and Gambier-Parry agreed. Scroll down for video .

Mr. Abadi had been expected to seek billions of dollars in drones and other U.S. weapons during his visit.

President Barack Obama announced today $200 million in additional U.S. humanitarian aid to Iraq, but declined to say whether Washington would provide Apache helicopters, drones and other arms to Baghdad to help with the ongoing fight against ISIS . 'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, left . Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becoming prime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meant to convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has sought to be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq. The Obama administration, which welcomed Abadi's ascension after a tricky relationship with former Prime Minister Nurial-Maliki, may not agree to provide significant additional support. Obama, who was elected on the back of a promise to end the war in Iraq, is limited by public aversion to U.S. entanglement in another regional conflict and congressional constraints on his budget authority. In August, Obama authorized the first U.S. air strikes on Iraq since the 2011 withdrawal of American troops. He has also deployed about 3,000 American military forces to train and advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight Islamic State. Abadi said after the meeting that Iraq would respect other countries' sovereignty and expected the same. He also said he was eager to bring all of the fighters in Iraq under state control. 'I am aware that regional countries have their own interests and I respect these interests, but I also welcome any assistance that they would provide, and I would like to thank them,' Abadi said through a translator. 'However, we do not accept any intervention in Iraq or any transgression on Iraqi sovereignty. This is a war that is fought with Iraqi blood with help from the coalition forces and regional countries.' The U.S. president in turn warned Iran that its fighters must respect Iraq's sovereignty and answer to the government in Baghdad in the battle against ISIS.

His meeting with Obama is meantto convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has soughtto be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq . Vice President Joe Biden, left,  and National Security Advisor Susan Rice also participated in the Oval Office discussion of the strategic partnership between the two countries, support in fighting ISIS as well as commercial and cultural relations . Iran-backed Shi'ite militias have played a major and growing role in battling the Sunni Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL, that emerged from the chaos in Iraq and neighboring Syria and which swept through northern Iraq last June. Abadi has had to rely on Shi'ite militias, some of which are backed by Iran and advised by Iranian military officers, as Iraq's regular military deserted en masse last summer in the face of the Islamic State onslaught. Obama said he and Abadi discussed the issue at length in their Oval Office meeting on Tuesday. Asked about Iranian involvement in Iraq, Obama said that he expected the neighbors to have an 'important relationship,' and recognized that the mobilization of Shi'ite militias had been necessary to counter ISIL's advance last year. But he added that any foreign-backed groups in Iraq should now be under Abadi's control. 'Once Prime Minister Abadi took power ... from that point on, any foreign assistance that is helping to defeat ISIL has to go through the Iraqi government. That's how you respect Iraqi sovereignty,' Obama said. 'It needs to be help that is not simply coordinated with the Iraqi government, but ultimately is answerable to the Iraqi government and is funneled through the chain of command.'","Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi had been expected to seek billions of dollars in drones and other U.S. weapons during his visit to the Oval Office .

After police made it known they were investigating foul play, Mr Edwards said his family started to face the harsh reality that his mother may never be coming home. ‘It could be a real possibility and I guess after all this time it feels like there is really only one outcome left.’ Mr Edwards said regardless of how it happens, he wants his mum brought home.

As we know, the Premier League has the money and prestige, but what the FA Cup has is history, and boy does the BBC love a bit of history? Lest you were in any doubt, its coverage of the semi-final kicked off with footage of the late Sir Laurence Olivier doing the St Crispin's Day speech from the film of Henry V ('We happy few, We band of brothers,' and so on). Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Jason Roberts and Ian Wright fronted the BBC's coverage at Wembley . BBC presenter Lineker prepares to present the Match of the Day 50th anniversary special broadcast . Reading defender Nathaniel Chaloboah (left) chases Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey (right) on Saturday . Gunners forward Alexis Sanchez celebrates after scoring his side's winning goal in the FA Cup semi-final . Stand-in Match of the Day presenter Gabby Logan (left) with pundits Phil Neville and Robbie Savage (right) The excuse, I guess, was that Reading's nickname is the Royals, but as the second-tier team are also known as the Biscuitmen. The BBC even gave us a moment of history at half-time with a breakdown, something that used to be a regular feature of TV outside broadcasts, when a feature on Crystal Palace's shock semi-final victory over Liverpool 25 years ago came to a shuddering halt halfway through. In such instances, the BBC is lucky to retain the services of Gary Lineker, the best presenter of live football on TV. Sky have never really replaced the disgraced Richard Keys, who had the benefit of longevity in the post. The BBC needs to fight hard to avoid Lineker falling into the hands of rivals. Not that Sky's presenters are less than competent — David Jones did the job — but it's never a good sign when you have to go to Google to check which one it is. The price of live Premier League football is now way beyond the reach of the BBC, which may be the clincher in Lineker's future. While the BBC's match had the lion's share of the goalmouth action, it was difficult to resist turning over to Sky on occasion. Having invested its billions in the Premier League, Sky doesn't skimp on the peripheries. The sound always seems a little crisper, and in punditry, where Sky offers us the Rolls Royce of analysts, Gary Neville, the BBC counters with the mid-range Danny Murphy. In the commentary box, Sky fields Martin Tyler for its big games in the knowledge he'll rarely make a bad call, while the BBC never seems sure who its best commentator is. The man on the job on Saturday, Steve Wilson, is unfussy and made the most of what was the bigger story. The outcome on Sky was depressingly predictable. The BBC may miss out on the Premier League's pricey weekly thrills, but took the biscuit on Saturday. The BBC's Dan Walker talks pitchside with Sportsmail's Martin Keown at Wembley .

Tennessee last executed a prisoner in 2009. Since then, legal challenges and problems obtaining lethal injection drugs have stalled new executions. In 2013 and 2014, the state tried to jump-start the process with a new one-drug lethal injection method and the reinstatement of the electric chair as a backup. The Tennessee Supreme Court has vacated the execution dates of the last four men on the state's death row as new lethal injection methods are challenged. Above, electrocution has been designated as a backup method . Beginning in December 2013, the court set new execution dates for 11 inmates. One inmate died in prison, and the execution dates for the others have been postponed as they approach because of legal challenges to the new methods. On Friday, the court postponed the last of the scheduled execution dates. It will set new dates after the legal questions are settled. States across the country have been struggling to find a method of execution that will stand up to legal challenges. And obtaining lethal injection drugs has been getting harder. As manufacturers have refused to sell drugs to prisons for executions, prison officials across the US have turned to compounding pharmacies, which make drugs specifically for individual clients. But those versions have also become difficult to come by because pharmacists are reluctant to expose themselves to possible harassment. Last month, the American Pharmacists Association adopted a policy discouraging its members from providing drugs for lethal injections, saying that runs contrary to the role of pharmacists as health care providers. Death row inmates challenging Tennessee's lethal injection method recently submitted an affidavit from University of Utah College of Pharmacy professor James H. Ruble that questions whether even a willing compounding pharmacist could provide the pentobarbital that Tennessee and several other states need for executions. Leroy Hall Jr, 48 (left) and Nicholas Todd Sutton, 53 (right) were both convicted of murder in 1991 and 1985, respectively. They no longer have dates for execution in Tennessee . Donald Strouth, 56 (left) and Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman, 64 (right) were also both convicted of murder, though the European Union has called for Abdur'Rahman, who is believed to be mentally ill, to be allowed to live . Ruble says in the affidavit that the main ingredient for pentobarbital is unavailable from the six primary commercial sources that compounding pharmacists buy their ingredients from. The Tennessee Supreme Court's recent ruling will vacate the execution dates for Leroy Hall Jr, 48, Donald Wayne Strouth, 56, Nicholas Todd Sutton, 53, and Abu-Ali Abdur’Rahman, 64. Hall was convicted of premeditated murder and aggravated arson after burning his ex-girlfriend to death in 1991. Strouth was convicted of murdering a clothing store owner in 1978 by slitting his throat after he was knocked unconscious with a rock. Sutton was sentenced to death for stabbing a fellow inmate to death in 1985 after originally being sent to prison for child molestation. Abdur'Rahman, formerly James Lee Jones,  received his death penalty sentence for the murder of a Nashville cocaine dealer in 1986 while he was a remember of a militant Christian group looking to eliminate drugs from its neighborhood. The case of Abdur'Rahman, who was reportedly seriously abused by his parents as a child, has drawn international attention and the European Union called for a stay. He is believed to be mentally ill and had ineffective counsel during his trial, according to his website. There are 69 people on Tennessee's death row. The Tennessee Supreme Court (pictured) is waiting for verdicts about the constitutionality of the lethal injection drug pentobarbital . Tennessee last year reinstated electrocution as an alternative if lethal injection drugs are unavailable or a court rules the procedure unconstitutional. But that change has brought yet another legal challenge. Other states of the 31 with the death penalty are considering their own alternatives. Utah last month reinstated the firing squad as a backup method if it can't obtain lethal injection drugs. In Oklahoma, lawmakers approved nitrogen gas as a backup execution method. The state's Republican Governor Mary Fallin supports the death penalty but has not said whether she will sign the bill. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf suspended his state's death penalty in February, citing the inefficiency of long court proceedings and expense. Ohio and Georgia are delaying all of their executions while investigation their lethal injection drug protocols. The US Supreme Court will hear a case later this month about the first substance in a so-called 'three drug cocktail', which is supposed to render the person being executed unconscious so they will not feel pain for the second two drugs. Scrutiny on the death penalty has increased since an execution using the drug, midazolam, resulted in an Oklahoma inmate writhing in presumed pain before dying 43 minutes after the procedure began. Tennessee uses only one drug in its protocol, the sedative pentobarbital. There are 69 people in death row in the state, according to the Department of Corrections. The Tennessee Supreme Court order said that their execution dates have previously been vacated for legal challenges.","Tennessee Supreme Court vacates execution dates for four men .

200,73259bc6ec97c1d839e8c4961985bde64e726148,"After experiencing major devastation and loss of life in the April 25 earthquake, Nepal was left with an unsavoury taste in its mouth after receiving packets of ‘beef masala’ as part of the relief package from Pakistan. Since the majority-Hindu country treats cows as sacred and there is a blanket ban on slaughtering the animal, the development has the potential to trigger diplomatic acrimony between the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) member countries. Indian doctors at Kathmandu’s Bir Hospital told Mail Today that packets of ‘beef masala’ were sent by Pakistan on Tuesday as part of relief aid to the temblor survivors. These doctors – drawn from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) — are members of a 34-member medical team sent to Nepal for treating the survivors. “When we reached the airport to collect the food items from Pakistan, we found packets of ready-to-eat meals, including packets of ‘beef masala’. There were other food items too,” Dr Balwinder Singh told Mail Today. Perplexed, the doctors chose to have food from a hotel instead. “We did not touch the Pakistani aid,” Dr Singh said. “Most of the local people are not aware of the contents. When they understand, they avoid it,” said another doctor on the condition of anonymity. He added: “Pakistan has hurt Nepal’s religious sentiments by supplying the masala. Shockingly, it did not care about the sensitivity of the matter.” Pakistani soldiers load relief supplies for Nepal . Exclusive photographs of the ‘beef masala’ packets supplied to Nepal are with Mail Today. These pictures clearly show that the place of origin of these packets was Nowshera Cantt in Pakistan. These packets also prominently mention that these are not for sale and the contents include ‘potato bhujia’ and ‘beef masala’. A top Nepal government official said: “The matter has been conveyed to Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and the intelligence chief. We are also starting an internal inquiry to verify the facts. If the report is correct, we will raise the matter at the diplomatic level with Pakistan. India, being our key partner, will also be informed of the developments.” Tasneem Aslam, spokesperson for Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs, told Mail Today: “I am not aware of the issue…I am not responsible for the dispatch. The relief aid is sent by the National Disaster Management Authority.” Nepalese soldiers stand next to wrecked buildings at Durbar Square . A press note uploaded on the website of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Pakistan (http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new/), states: “(The) National Disaster Management Authority has dispatched the second of two sorties of C-130 aircrafts on April 28 in collaboration with Pakistan Army, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Pakistan Air Force. The relief goods include 250 tents, 200 food packs (2.6 tonne), 1,000 Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), 1,000 blankets and 33 cartons of medicines. These relief goods have been provided from NDMA stocks….” Despite repeated attempts, the officials of the Pakistan NDMA could not be contacted. The food items have been manufactured by PANA Force Foods. The consignment was supplied after receiving orders from Pakistan’s NDMA. “PANA Force food processing centre aims at providing quality goods at affordable prices. Currently, the company is supplying two brands of products to Pakistan Army commonly known as Meal Ready to Eat (MRE) and Emergency Pack Ration (EP Ration or high-energy biscuits) whereas a plant for the production of dehydrated vegetables and fruits is under construction,” the official website of PANA Force Foods mentions. The website also states that the processing centre provides food to civil population during natural calamities, like earthquakes and floods. According to Hindu belief, eating beef is a religious offence since the cow is a sacred animal and treated on a par with one’s mother. In Nepal — for long the world’s only Hindu state — the first royal order officially prohibiting cow slaughter stated that the punishments for the crime were death and confiscation of all property of the offender. The first Civil Code of Nepal, the Muluki Ain of 1854, stated: “This kingdom is the only kingdom in the world where cows, women, and Brahmins may not be killed.” It trumpeted Nepal as the ‘purest Hindu kingdom’ and simultaneously signaled to Nepalese citizens that Hindu religious creeds would be the law of the land. But an amendment in 1990 to the Civil Code made cow slaughter punishable by 12 years in prison. Delhi High Court raises alarm over illegal buildings . By Mail Today in New Delhi . Municipal authorities in Delhi received a rap from the Delhi High Court on Wednesday over the numerous illegal buildings across the city. Days after the killer earthquake in Nepal, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday said unauthorised constructions and colonies in the city are disasters waiting to happen. A bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva observed that if an earthquake hits Delhi like the one in Nepal, all the unauthorised buildings constructed without following regulations, will crumble. It also said each government has been extending the date till which illegal constructions are protected from punitive action as it is looking for votes. “If people die, then who will vote?” the court asked. “They are disasters waiting to happen. Are you (municipal corporations) taking strict action? Are you coming out with an action plan?” the bench questioned while hearing a batch of petitions on unauthorised constructions in the city. In response, the civic agency said it was coming out with an action plan. The court, thereafter, said it will take up the matter of seismic viability of structures in the national Capital in some other appropriate matter. UK aid team in security breach at Delhi airport . By Ankur Sharma in New Delhi . It has come to light that a rescue team which arrived from the United Kingdom on Monday for operations in earthquake-hit Nepal, violated the safety norms of the Delhi IGI Airport. The team allegedly waited in front of an aircraft at the ‘apron area’ of the airport for about six hours before they could fly to Kathmandu. According to the members of the British rescue team, after waiting for all those hours, they were accommodated in a flight of the Spanish Air Force. Members of the British rescue team headed to Nepal posted photos of themselves waiting at IGI Airport on Twitter . According to a senior civil aviation official, it was a case of gross violation of safety rules. The DGCA can take action against the agencies that were responsible for the violation. “DGCA had earlier punished various airlines for committing such a violation. This particular British team had dogs with them and they were in front of the aircraft for six hours. It’s scary,” a senior DGCA official said after seeing the photographs of the group that were posted by a rescue team member on Twitter. An immigration official said the British group comprised 15-20 personnel from the UK Fire and Rescue team. They reached Delhi IGI Airport around 5.30pm on Monday. But due to weather and other clearance issues, they were asked to wait at the airport. “The team didn’t have proper clearances. India keeps a watch on every unit and aircraft flying to Kathmandu through Delhi. Airport officials asked them to wait but instead of going to the terminal building, these rescue team members waited in front of the nosewheel of an aircraft,” a senior airport official told Mail Today. Later, when the Indian agencies told them that the weather in Kathmandu was not favourable and it was packed with aircraft, the British rescue team members arranged their materials on their own, the official said. After almost an hour they managed to convince the Spanish Air Force officials, who agreed to fly these British rescue team members to Kathmandu. “Even then, the rescue team members didn’t go inside the airport. No security official asked them to move from there. They remained there for more than three hours,” a senior immigration official said. “They had equipment which needed to be checked by various agencies. Also, they didn’t take proper permission due to which they were asked to wait. But, they ignored all security rules and stayed there in front of an aircraft,” a senior airport official said. According to a senior official of the ministry of civil aviation: “No one is allowed to wait in front of an aircraft. Even the passengers are not allowed to put their baggage near to the plane.” The team reportedly left Delhi around 12 midnight and reached Kathmandu around 2am.","Cows are treated as sacred in Nepal, where the majority are Hindus .

201,bc82c9e1be8d81ddf3ba0c30fb47f552088241c3,"When journalist Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's rapidly growing, yet unregulated, gestational surrogacy industry for HBO documentary series Vice, she didn't anticipate 'how dark' the story would get. For nearly two years, the producer and host has been reporting on current issues across the globe and has covered everything from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay to the effect of climate change on polar bears - but nothing could have prepared her for the moment when someone offered to sell her a baby over dinner while she was working undercover in India. 'It was the most heartbreaking experience that I ever had,' Gianna told Daily Mail Online. Baby business: Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni (pictured) traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry . Shady deal: The journalist from Brooklyn, New York, went undercover to meet with an agent in India who offered to get her a baby in two to three months . But the heartbreak did not end there. As Gianna quickly learned during her time working on the Outsourcing Embryos documentary, surrogacy in India is a multi-million dollar business, and one which is made all the more lucrative by the high number of American couples traveling to the country in order to use the services provided by one or more of the ‘embryo outsourcing’ agencies featured in the Vice documentary. During her time spent undercover posing as one of these people, Gianna was informed that, in order to maximize profits and ensure a final product, doctors are encouraged to implant multiple embryos in surrogates, which can lead to the surrogate having to abort one of the fetuses or give birth to multiple babies. And if an 'extra' baby is born, it isn't necessarily going home with its genetic parents. There are also issues with couples never making it to India to claim their children for whatever reasons, meaning that the newborn baby is left without a parent. For the most recent episode in the Vice series, Gianna went undercover to meet with one surrogacy agent who claimed over dinner that she could get her a Caucasian baby in two to three months - confirming that there were in fact ‘extra’ babies being sold on the black market. The agent then tried to convince Gianna and her team to buy the baby that they had brought with them to the restaurant. Shocking offer: One of the agents can be seen holding the baby that they brought to the restaurant with them . No morals: The agent eventually offered to sell Gianna and her team the baby over dinner . Gianna noted that the agent spoke with a 'shocking amount of ease' and 'talked about forging documents as if she has done it a hundred times' as she tried to sell her and her team a baby over dinner. 'It made me think it wasn't a one-off thing,' she explained to Daily Mail Online. Gianna never once considered buying the baby, but as a woman who would one day like to be a mother, she admitted that there was a moment when she thought about accepting the offer, knowing that she could provide the child with a loving home that it may never experience otherwise, particularly as it was made clear that the agent would have sold the baby to anybody. 'When I go on these stories, I am a human being first and a journalist second,' she said of her initial reaction to the offer. The sale of 'extra' babies on the black market was just one of the many shocking side effects of commercial surrogacy uncovered by Gianna and her team. In the US, surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $100,000, and Gianna explained that 'the reoccurring theme' when speaking with American agents and experts about couples hiring surrogates from other countries was money. Commercial surrogacy in India costs nearly one-sixth the amount it would in the Western World. 'That seems to be the main driver,' she explained, before noting that some prospective parents do choose foreign surrogacy because of the altruistic element. No options: Many of the surrogates who spoke with Gianna said that they decided to carry a baby because they desperately needed the money . Dormitory: The women who agree to be surrogates at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic have to live at the facility until they give birth . Tight quarters: Two surrogates can be see sitting on the beds in their shared room . And while American parents see the surrogacy business in India as being a ‘cheap’ alternative to the services offered at home, the amount of money made by a surrogate in India can vastly change her life, as well as the life of her family. Women can use the money to buy a home or send their own children to school, and Gianna explained that there are in fact couples who take great efforts to make sure their surrogates are a part of their lives. But there are also countless tales of financially desperate women who are recruited in the slums and coerced into signing contracts that they can't read, only to be duped out of the money they were promised. When I go on these stories I am a human being first and a journalist second . Surrogates undergo scheduled cesarean sections so doctors can ensure the greatest number of births per day. Gianna, who witnessed the high turnover rate first hand at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic, in the town of Gujarat, in the west of India, was nearly speechless when she saw how rapidly newborns and their parents were whisked away following a surrogate's C-section. Dr Patel maintained that the women are well taken care of and make more money than they could working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in any other profession. And while Gianna explained that some women are happy that they can provide a house for their family and put their kids through school as a surrogate, the women she and her team spoke to said they chose to be surrogates because they didn't have any other options. During the episode, a surrogate named Vasanti told Gianna: 'Nobody likes doing this.' Dishonest: Although Dr Patel maintained that she didn't search for surrogates from the slums, Gianna met a woman who said she was working for the clinic owner as tried to recruit women from a poor area . No choice: A doctor can be seen performing a cesarean section on one of the surrogates. Surrogates have to undergo C-sections so doctors can maximize the amount of babies being born in a day . Too quick: Almost immediately after this baby was born via a surrogate, the biological parents whisked the newborn away in a van as they went to return to their home country . She continued: 'I didn't have a home, so I thought I could build one by being a surrogate.’ Another surrogate named Nisha explained that she was 'helpless' and had 'no alternatives'. Gianna was overcome by many of the surrogates' desperation. 'It is really hard to hear someone talk about going through an experience that takes a toll on the body, that lasts longer than nine months and takes them away from their kids because they have to support their families and essentially survive,' she said. Gianna recalled speaking with one surrogate's husband who recently lost his job and he confessed that he was grateful his wife had the opportunity to earn money for their family as a surrogate. He made clear that he didn't force her into the role, but explained that it was necessary for their family's survival. 'It all went back to money,' Gianna noted. As a whole, Gianna said that she thinks some parents may be aware of the 'shadier side' of commercialized surrogacy, but a 'vast majority’ have no idea this dark underbelly exits. Gianna recommends that parents who are considering foreign surrogacy options should do extensive research on the agent, the doctor and the surrogate they will be working with.","Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry for the HBO series .

203,e03bd819c47d90a3bdaf707bb2a4905fd627cadb,"Letting the Scottish Nationalists dictate the direction of the UK government would be like getting King Herod to 'run a baby farm', Boris Johnson warned today in an escalation of Tory attacks on the SNP. The Tory London Mayor warned against allowing Nicola Sturgeon's SNP to dominate the government of the UK, 'an entity that they are sworn to destroy'. He likened it to 'asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery'. Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson warned against allowing Nicola Sturgeon's SNP to dominate the government of the UK 'an entity that they are sworn to destroy' Ms Sturgeon launched her SNP manifesto today, boasting that she can 'lead the UK' with polices on British foreign policy, benefits, energy bills and English university tuition fees. The SNP leader vowed to use a surge in support for her party to dictate the direction of the UK government, calling for an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Ed Miliband would have to pay for propping up a weak Labour government. Ms Sturgeon set out a 'programme for delivery on a UK-wide basis', raising the prospect of Scottish nationalist MPs calling the shots on policies which apply only in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Polls suggest up to half of Scots are planning to vote SNP, handing the party dozens of seats and leaving Labour's Ed Miliband unable to secure a majority. The SNP has claimed that it will be 'entitled to vote against any bit of legislation' and 'any bit of spending' it does not agree with. Mr Johnson, who is expected to play a more high profile role in the Tory campaign from this week, issued a blunt warning about allowing an anti-Union party to dictate policy in Westminster. 'You wouldn't get Herod to run a baby farm, would you?,' he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. 'It would not normally occur to you to interview a convicted jewel thief for the post of custodian of the Tower of London. 'You would not dream of asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery or Attila the Hun to work as a doorkeeper for the Roman senate. 'Any such course of action would be totally nuts. So can someone tell me why in the name of all that is holy there are some apparently rational people who are even contemplating the elevation of the Scottish Nationalist Party to a position of effective dominance in the government of the United Kingdom - an entity that they are sworn to destroy?' He said the SNP want to 'end Britain, to decapitate Britannia' but Mr Miliband has no chance of entering Number 10 without their support. Nicola Sturgeon today demanded an end to austerity as the price for propping up a Labour government in what was quickly dubbed a £140billion 'ransom note' for Britain . The SNP want higher taxes, to scrap Trident and end efforts to reform the welfare system, Mr Johnson warned. Mr Miliband will be left 'sitting in the driving seat, pretending to be steering the car - but all the time he will have clever Nicola next to him, whispering in his ear, and perpetually yanking the steering wheel to the Left'. Speaking at her manifesto launch, Ms Sturgeon said she had not 'heard the comments of Boris Johnson directly'. But speaking at the SNP manifesto launch, she said: 'If he did say that, then that is an entirely offensive comment, and I think it will be treated as that not just by people in Scotland but across the UK, who, in my experience, ordinary people the length and breadth of the UK do not see Scotland that way at all and do not see the SNP in that way at all.' However, the warning was echoed by David Cameron today, in a speech setting out the risks to England, Wales and Northern Ireland if the Scottish Nationalists are calling the shots. The Prime Minister yesterday suggested key services like roads and hospitals in the rest of the UK would suffer as a price of SNP support. ''This would be the first time on our history that a group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of the government of our country. I think that is a frightening prospect,' he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show. 'People thinking in their own constituencies, is that bypass going to be built, will my hospital get the money it needs? Frankly this is a group of people that wouldn't care about what happened in the rest of the country. 'The rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, wouldn't get a look-in. 'That is the prospect we face if we don't get the majority Conservative government that is in our reach.'","London Mayor warns the SNP want to 'end Britain, to decapitate Britannia'

204,934a2d9235022c9e8a6aeec5e7e941b127569b76,"(CNN)The world's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world, is ready for action following a two-year shutdown. After problems that delayed the restart in March, scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) completed final tests, enabling the first beams to start circulating Sunday inside the LHC's 17 mile (27 km) ring. ""Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN's here for,"" CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer said on the organization's website. ""Today, CERN's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC."" The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second, with a beam circulating for 10 hours, traveling more than 6 billion miles (more than 10 billion kilometers) -- the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again. At near light-speed, a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second. It took thousands of scientists, engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator, housed in a tunnel between Lake Geneva and the Jura mountain range. The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the ""Big Bang"" -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe. By replicating the energy density and temperature, scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved. Our current, limited, knowledge is based on what's called The Standard Model of particle physics.  ""But we know that this model is not complete,"" Dr. Mike Lamont, operations group leader at the LHC, told CNN in March. The burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy, while others have no mass at all; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy, since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe. The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter, despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the Big Bang. CERN says the energies achievable by the LHC have only ever been found in nature. The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros (about $3.3 billion), paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non-member nations. The organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by Swiss and French laws and a European Council Directive. Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown. ""After two years of effort, the LHC is in great shape,"" said CERN Director for Accelerators and Technology, Frédérick Bordry. ""But the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels."" Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.","The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) begins again after a two-year shutdown .

In a photo album that spans over China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, extraordinary images portray the crop's full cycle from the primitive sowing of seeds to the distribution of millions of tonnes for consumption. The pictures were taken by professional photographer Scott Gable, 39, who spent four months travelling across the region documenting the labour and threadbare equipment used to harvest the carbohydrate-rich food. Scroll down for video . Majestic: A farmer wades through the mud with a stick as late morning rain falls on top of Dragonsbone terraces in Longsheng County, China . Rice is a staple food for more than one-half the world's population, but for many consumers, its origin remains somewhat of a mystery. The crop accounts for one fifth of all calories consumed by humans and 87 per cent of it is produced in Asia. It is also the thirstiest crop there is - according to the UN, farmers need at least 2,000 litres of water to make one kilogram of rice. Mr Gable said he was determined to capture every stage of production with his Rice Project - from the planting to the harvesting all the way down to the shipping of the food. After acquiring some contacts from experts at Cornell University in New York and conducting his own research, he left for China last May and spent the next four months traveling. He said: 'The images were taken over a four month period from April to July last year across Asia. I visited China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as part of my Rice Project.

'The project is one part of a larger three part project on global food staples - rice, corn and wheat. I am currently in the process of shooting the corn segment. 'The industrialisation of our food and mono-culture food staples have interested me for some time so that's probably what inspired me to do this project. 'I shot the whole project using a Canon SLR and GoPros. The actual shooting took four months and then post production took another four more months. 'The reaction to my work has been incredibly positive - I was able to secure a solo gallery show and create quite a bit of interest online which has been great.'

Arduous labour: Employees of Taiwan's state-run rice experimental station are pictured beating rice husks by hand as the sun shines on them . Mr Gable spent months learning Mandarin Chinese in preparation for his trip, but the language barrier was still his greatest challenge. In an interview on photographic blog  Slate, he added: 'I had enough Chinese that I could get around in the big cities, but once I got into the highlands or mountains they don't speak Mandarin. 'There are so many different languages in China. That was very difficult. There's no iPhone translation for these dialects.' Mr Gable is already working on a new related project documenting corn production and after that, he plans to do a similar investigation of wheat. The three projects together form part of his mission to inspire people to think about food and its origins in an enlightened way.

Tucked inside the stage adapter - the ring connecting Orion to the top propulsion stage of the SLS -will be 11 self-contained small satellites, each about the size of a large shoebox. Now, the space agency has revealed three missions that will use these small satellites during the test flight to help develop technologies for astronauts travelling to deep space. A concept image of the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout mission, one of 11 missions that will be secondary payloads to the first test flight of Nasa's Space Launch System . 'Nasa is taking advantage of a great opportunity to conduct more science beyond our primary focus of this mission,' said Jody Singer manager of Nasa's Flight Programs and Partnerships Office. 'While this new vehicle will enable missions beyond Earth orbit, we're taking steps to increase the scientific and exploration capability of SLS by accommodating small, CubeSat-class payloads.' The first is a Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout, using solar sail propulsion, will fly by a small asteroid, taking pictures and making observations. It aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid. BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit . Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout, using solar sail propulsion, will fly by a small asteroid, taking pictures and making observations. It aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid. Lunar Flashlight will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that, once broken down into their component molecules, could be used in future exploration. The hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials, propellant, oxygen and water. BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit. This will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before. 'A solar sail works best when deployed in deep space and SLS will get us there,' said Les Johnson, principal investigator for NEA Scout at Marshall. 'It will take us out of Earth orbit and to interplanetary space - where we need to be to deploy the solar sail. It's a perfect ride to begin our mission.' Nasa's Lunar Flashlight will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that, once broken down into their component molecules, could be used in future exploration. The hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials, propellant, oxygen and water. Lunar Flashlight will use a large solar sail, similar to the NEA Scout sail, to reflect sunlight and illuminate the moon's permanently shadowed craters and then the science instruments will measure the surface water ice. Meanwhile, BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit. This will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before. The BioSentinel mission will be the first time living organisms have travelled to deep space in over 40 years and the spacecraft will operate in the deep space radiation environment throughout its 18-month mission. The experiments will be launched by Houston-based Nasa in 2018 during a test flight of the Orion spacecraft using the largest, most powerful rocket booster ever built; the Space Launch System . The missions are a key part of the historic test flight, dubbed Exploration Mission-1. About 10 minutes after Orion and its service module escape the pull of Earth's gravity, the two will disconnect and Orion will proceed toward the moon. Once Orion is a safe distance away, the small payloads will begin to be deployed, all at various times during the flight depending on the particular missions. These CubeSats are small nano-satellites designed to be efficient and versatile. The masses of these secondary payloads are light - no heavier than 30lb (14kg). They will essentially piggyback on the SLS flight, providing what otherwise would be costly access to deep space. 'We are expanding the capabilities of this particular SLS test flight,' said Joseph Pelfrey, deputy manager of the Exploration and Space Transportation Development Office at Marshall. 'The rocket will be the strongest ever built by Nasa and we want to take advantage of that design. 'Flying secondary payloads is something we plan to do for missions to come and provide the science community an opportunity they haven't had before.'

Lorna McCarthy feared for her life in the hours leading up to her death at the hands of Barry McCarthy, the man she had spent 25 years with before their separation four months earlier. Mrs McCarthy, 50, sent a series of messages to friends and family on September 27, including one to her daughter saying she didn't know 'what he is capable of these days'. She urged her daughter to call the police if she did not hear from her the next day - but it was never received. Lorna McCarthy (left) was stabbed through the heart by her husband Barry McCarthy (right) last September . The couple, who were still sharing a home in Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk, but sleeping in separate bedrooms, had had an argument. McCarthy, 51, had previously found out his wife was using dating websites. But she had agreed to take her profile down after he confronted her, Norfolk Police said. But in the early hours of September 28, Mrs McCarthy revealed she did not want to try to save the relationship, Norwich Crown Court heard. A little later, he entered her bedroom and stabbed her 13 times, according to the Eastern Daily Press. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had died from a stab wound to the heart. McCarthy then handed himself into police, telling them he had killed his wife, the court heard. When officers went to their home, they found Mrs McCarthy - who her daughter described to the BBC as a 'very colourful' and 'well-known' - in the back bedroom. McCarthy will be sentenced on May 1, after being found guilty of murder at Norwich Crown Court . McCarthy pleaded not guilty to murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. But a jury today found him guilty of murder following a eight-day trial. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Durham said: 'This was a horrific and brutal attack on a woman in her own home by a man she had spent 25 years of her life with. 'My thoughts go out to Lorna's family and friends, and I hope today's verdict will help bring them some comfort as they still try to come to terms with her tragic death.'

209,d57f761765222c8d2aa602c2110925e2c0f16437,"The belief that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, a leading professor of psychiatry has claimed. David Healy, head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatric unit in Bangor, North Wales, said the misconception that low levels of serotonin were responsible for depression had become established fact. He suggested that the success of so-called SSRI drugs – which include Prozac and Seroxat – was based on the ‘marketing of a myth’. Scroll down for video . The idea that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, psychiatrist Professor David Healy argues. Pictured is Prozac, one commonly prescribed  SSRI . The emergence of these serotonin reuptake inhibiting (SSRI) drugs in the late 1980s came after concerns about tranquilliser use to treat depression. Even though they were weaker than old-style tricyclic antidepressants, they took off because of the idea that SSRIs restored serotonin levels to normal, ‘a notion that later transmuted into the idea that they remedied a chemical imbalance’. In an editorial in the BMJ, Professor Healy said that in the 1990s, no one knew if SSRIs raised or lowered serotonin levels but there was no evidence that treatment corrected anything. He said: ‘For doctors it provided an easy short hand for communication with patients. ‘For patients, the idea of correcting an abnormality has a moral force that can be expected to overcome the scruples some might have had about taking a tranquilliser, especially when packaged in the appealing form that distress is not a weakness.’ However, other psychiatrists have refuted the professor’s claims, saying the profession has moved on from a simplistic description of the pills correcting a chemical imbalance. They warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘real world’. Depression should be re-defined as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder, argues one scientist. The condition could result from a parasitic, bacterial or viral infection and future research into the condition should search for these micro-organisms, argues Dr. Turhan Canli, of Stony Brook University, U.S. If his theory is true, he hopes a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future. Writing in the journal Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Dr Canli said: 'It is time for an entirely different approach. 'Instead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder, I suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease. 'I propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites, bacteria, or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression.' Professor Sir Simon Wessely, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ‘That antidepressants are helpful in depression, together with psychological treatments, is established. How they do this is not. ‘Most researchers have long since moved on from the old serotonin model. ‘Most important of all, SSRIs are safer if taken in overdose than the older tricyclics. ‘People should not change their current medication on the basis of this editorial alone.’ NHS Choices, the website which advises patients, says: ‘It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms.’ Professor Healy’s editorial says it is important to raise questions about the drugs. He said: ‘In other areas of life the products we use, from computers to microwaves, improve year on year, but this is not the case for medicines, where this year’s treatments may achieve blockbuster sales despite being less effective and less safe than yesterday’s models. ‘The emerging sciences of the brain offer enormous scope to deploy any amount of neurobabble. 'We need to understand the language we use. Until then, so long, and thanks for all the serotonin’, he concludes. Professor David Taylor, Director of Pharmacy and Pathology and Head of Pharmaceutical Sciences Clinical Academic Group, King’s Health Partners, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Professor Healy makes a forceful but poorly supported argument against something which doesn’t and has never really existed: the idea that SSRIs ‘correct’ an ‘imbalance’ of serotonin in the brain. ‘Researchers and psychiatrists alike know that SSRIs are effective in a number of disorders but no one is sure exactly how they work. Their readily demonstrable effect is on serotonin but they have many indirect secondary effects in the brain. Other psychiatrists warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘real world’ ‘Prof Healy fails to mention that SSRIs supplanted earlier tricyclics largely because of their relative safety in overdose, not because of any conspiracy concerning a theory of serotonin’s involvement in depression.’ Dr Paul Keedwell, Consultant Psychiatrist and Specialist in Mood Disorders, said: ‘In the real world of the clinic, SSRIs are undeniably effective in treating individuals with major depression. 'They have become the first line treatment of choice because they have fewer troublesome side-effects than their predecessors, and are safer in overdose. ‘David Healy has previously claimed that SSRIs cause dependence or provoke suicide. ‘In so doing he has risked deterring individuals with severe depression from getting the help they need and this latest article just adds to this problem. ‘The risk of suicide from untreated depression is much greater than the risk of treating it with antidepressants, and yes, this includes SSRIs.’","David Healy is head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatry unit in Bangor .

210,11389d4d81ab5ac12b2f4fcbe67f6f7b69bdf37f,"George Osborne dodged questions over plans to offer more help to the country's top earners . Labour and Tory politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the Chancellor's admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the Government's priorities. George Osborne has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country's top earners, offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than £50,000 could see the rate lowered. Instead he says the Conservatives are committed to raising the tax-free personal allowance bracket from £10,000 to £12,500. Raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least £50,000 was also a priority, he said. At present anyone earning between £31,866 to £150,000 is taxed at the higher rate. Those earning above £150,000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45 per cent. But Labour politicians are calling for the amount to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the highest bracket. Accusing the current Government of prioritising 'helping the very richest', Shadow chief secretary Chris Leslie condemned the Chancellor's refusal to rule out offering reduced tax rates on high income salaries. When pressed in an interview with Sky News the Chancellor refused to rule out making further cuts for Britain's top earners, instead saying the issue was 'not a priority'. 'If that was our priority or our plan we would have made it part of our plan and made it one of our priorities. Scroll down for video . 'That's not our plan. Judge us by what we want to do and what we want to do is increase the tax-free personal allowance to £12,500 so people full-time on the minimum wage don't have to pay income tax and millions are better off,' he said. 'And when it comes to higher rate taxpayers our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate, the 40p rate, to £50,000.' 'Those are our big tax commitments for the coming parliament.' The Chancellor added that any deal between Labour and SNP would harm the country, claiming the latter's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was 'much stronger' than the opposition leader . He also refused to commit to devoting 2 per cent of the budget to defence, the limit agreed by NATO members. David Cameron has faced repeated calls to commit to spending 2 per cent of the budget on defence . 'We made a commitment at Nato. We are spending it today. We have made a clear commitment to the future of the equipment budget, to increase that in real terms ..,. and we have made commitments on the size of the armed forces,' he said. 'I don't think anyone should be in any doubt ... about our commitment to strong national security'. He also said any deal struck between the SNP and Labour would harm the country, lambasting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to broker such a partnership as 'disturbing'. 'The fact that the Labour Party, that was a party that campaigned for the Union in the referendum, is contemplating an arrangement with the SNP, who want to break up the country, is deeply disturbing.' He added the Scottish nationalist leaders were 'much stronger' than the opposition leader who he said would be overrun if they entered a coalition together. 'That would be bad for the entire United Kingdom, bad for the integrity of the Union but also bad for our economy because it would mean higher debts and higher taxes.' He also accused Ed Balls of 'running scared' by not agreeing to a debate with him and Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

212,09edb9b8d03efcddc0479307c5f3219406654e95,"He may be a warrior in the ring, but Manny Pacquaio showed his humble side outside of it once more with his latest Instagram post. The 36-year-old is gearing up for his $300million welterweight showdown with Floyd Mayweather on May 2 - in what is set to become the richest bout in boxing history. But the Philipine star took time out of his preparation to thank American film director Spike Lee and Tito Mikey for their support so far. Manny Pacquiao took to Instagram to thank Spike Lee and Tito Mikey ahead of his bout vs Floyd Mayweather . The 36-year-old also posted a photo thanking NBA legend Karl Malone (centre left) for visiting him at the gym . 'Hello to all my fans in New York and thank you to Spike Lee and Tito Mikey for supporting Team Pacquiao,' Pacquaio said via Instagram on Thursday. 'I hope to see you soon. God bless.' The duo are just the latest to show their support for the 'Pac-man' ahead of his fight against Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas next month. Former two-time NBA MVP and 14-time All-Star Karl Malone is another who appears to be behind the camp of the southpaw boxer. Later on Thursday, Pacquaio took to Instagram again to post a picture with the 51-year-old at his Wild Card gym base in Los Angeles. Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, believes his man is ready to beat Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2 . Accompanied with the caption: 'Thank you Karl Malone for visiting me today. God Bless you and your family,' the pair are all smiles alongside trainer Freddie Roach. And speaking earlier in the week, Roach believes that his fighter has a better chance of beating Mayweather now than he did in 2010. Asked whether the 2010 or 2015 version of Pacquiao would have a better chance of victory against the unbeaten Mayweather, Roach told boxingscene.com : 'That is an interesting question because there are obviously trade-offs between the two versions of Manny. But I am convinced that the 2015 model is the more formidable fighter for a few reasons. 'Back in 2010, Manny was still growing into a welterweight. His first two welterweight fights were against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 and Miguel Cotto in 2009 where he only weighed 142 and 144 pounds respectively, and in between he dropped down to 138 to fight Ricky Hatton. 'Floyd has been campaining as a welterweight since 2005 and weighed 150 in his fight against De La Hoya so that might have given Floyd an advantage. I still like Manny's chances in that fight but I think the Manny of today has a lot more in his favour. Pacquiao is better equipped to beat Mayweather now than he was in 2010, according to his trainer Roach . Mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets Pacquiao next month . 'In 2010 the two-year age difference between the fighters was not significant to either, but that's not true today. Floyd at 38 is doing things he didn't do in the past. Floyd is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years. Mayweather remains the bookmakers' favourite for the $300million mega-fight next month but Roach is adamant that Pacquiao is primed to cause an upset. 'The 2015 version of Manny is more mature, smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version,' said Roach. 'He will be treating the ring like a chess board anticipating Floyd's moves - ready to cut him off and attack every time he creates an opening. 'I have all the confidence in the world that Manny is going to knock Floyd out on May 2.'

But while they have been able to put a date on when life appeared, they are still far from knowing how it appeared. Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago. Scroll down for video . Scientists believe life on Earth began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago, but they are still far from knowing how it appeared.  Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago . RNA, which stands for ribonucleic acid, is a molecule made up of one or more nucleotides. It is one of three major biological molecules that are essential for all known forms of life, along with DNA and proteins. The main job of RNA is to transfer the genetic code to create proteins from the nucleus to the ribosome. This prevents the DNA from having to leave the nucleus, and protects it from damage. It also acts as an on-and-off switch for some genes. The researchers believe these fragments used their innate self-evolving abilities to grow into repeated chemical chains long enough to evolve into primitive life. The study, by the University of Milan and University of Colorado Boulder, is based on a discovery in the 1980s that RNA can chemically alter its own structure. RNA is similar to DNA, and carries out a number of jobs in our cells, including acting as an on-and-off switch for some genes. Scientists believe that when life was in its early stages, RNA played a leading role in creating complex organisms before DNA and proteins were developed. Many origin-of-life researchers say that RNA chains are too specialised to have been created as a product of random chemical reactions. The new study, however, claims to provide an alternative theory by arguing primordial DNA-like fragments evolved in this way instead. The researchers found the self-assembly of DNA fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds. These connect together short DNA chains to form long ones, without the need for a separate biological process. The image shows a droplet of condensed nano-DNA and within it smaller drops of its liquid crystal phase which show up in polarised light on the left. The liquid crystal droplets act as 'micro-reactors' where short DNA can join together into long polymer chains to evolve into more complex life . 'Our observations are suggestive of what may have happened on the early Earth when the first DNA-like molecular fragments appeared,' said CU-Boulder physics Professor Noel Clark, a study co-author. The study suggests that the way in which DNA emerged in the early Earth lies in its structural properties and its ability to self-organise. In the pre-RNA world, the spontaneous self-assembly of fragments of nucleic acids – the building block of life - may have acted as a template for their chemical self-assembly. 'The new findings show that in the presence of appropriate chemical conditions, the spontaneous self-assembly of small DNA fragments into stacks of short duplexes greatly favours their binding into longer polymers, thereby providing a pre-RNA route to the RNA world,' added Professor Clark.","Scientists say early DNA-like fragments guided their own growth .

The 33-year-old, who is vying for a place on Team GB at the Rio Olympics, welcomed Mia Grace with husband Mike Tindall last year. But after finding herself 'surprised' by how her fitness dropped during pregnancy, the Queen's granddaughter has committed to a strict exercise and diet regime to get back in shape. Scroll down for video . Zara Phillips has told of how she was surprised at how difficult it was to regain her fitness after the birth of her daughter, Mia, one (pictured left in January and right, last July when Mia was six months old) 'What surprised me about having a baby is losing all your fitness and how tough it is to get it back to that level again,' she said in an interview with The Sunday Time Magazine. Starting her morning at 7am, Zara has a breakfast of Greek yogurt and honey and tries to get in a stint on the exercise bike at her home, Gatcombe Park, before Mia wakes at 8am. Her day is then typically spent with the horses kept at her mother, Princess Anne's stables, before squeezing in another workout. 'Lunch is quick and simple, like soup and a sandwich or eggs and toast. I don't diet but I try to eat well and not to eat too many carbohydrates or sugary things. Zara (pictured competing in the 2012 London Games) said she is keen to win a place on Team GB in 2016 . The 33-year-old (pictured with Jessica Ennis-Hill with their medals in 2012) is yet to qualify for the forthcoming Olympics . 'In the afternoon I'll do extra exercise like swimming or cycling.'

'I hope to be part of the eventing team that goes to the Olympics in Rio, but first I need to qualify.' A keen eventer, she said she is eager for daughter Mia to spend time around horses as she grows up. 'I expect Mia will grow up with horses all around her, just like her mum did,' she added. The one-year-old's father previously revealed the couple had 'three Shetland ponies waiting for her'. Speaking in an interview in January, Mr Tindall, who has recently taken part in the reality skiing show The Jump, said: 'Eventing children have to be very relaxed. 'You are going to travel around a lot.' Earlier this year Zara told of how little Mia enjoyed playing with her royal relatives Prince George and her cousins, Savannah and Isla. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia at Magic Millions Race Day in January she said of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge: 'We've all got small ones now so it's great fun.'

A beachfront property with spectacular views has gone on the market for £3million, and it is already drawing interest from viewers who are enamoured with the series’ stunning setting – and actor Aidan Turner’s chiselled looks. Since the series started airing last month estate agents said they have seen a rise in enquiries about the cottage, overlooking an ancient smugglers’ cove on Cornwall’s north coast, and other properties where the title character, Ross Poldark, plies his trade. Scroll down for video . A beachfront property with summer and winter cottages (middle, bottom left) has gone on the market for £3million in Cornwall . The property has stunning views of Smugglers Cove, and the summer and winter cottages are linked via a lift (pictured: summer cottage) Poldark actor Aidan Turner has become a heartthrob for fans after his character took off his shirt on the popular BBC One show . Ben Standen, from estate agents Jackson-Stops & Staff of Truro, said Smugglers Cottage in Smugglers Cove, near Portreath, has a summer and winter cottage, cleverly linked via a lift. Boasting seven bedrooms, six reception rooms and seven bathrooms, the property has direct access to the beach and an amazing view of uninterrupted coast and open sea. The summer cottage has three bedrooms and the winter cottage has four, and they can be used separately to provide lots of space for a family. Mr Standen said: ‘The fact it has direct access onto the beach and has these two houses linked by a lift - it's the sort of thing that comes on the market once every 20 or 30 years.’ The scenic county has always been a popular destination thanks to its rugged coastline, but interest in the programme, based on Winston Graham’s Poldark historical novels, set in the 18th century, is giving the local tourism and housing market a boost. Boasting seven bedrooms, six reception rooms and seven bathrooms, the stunning property has direct access to the beach . One of the larger bedrooms in the summer cottage offers amazing views of Smugglers Cove on the northern coast of Cornwall . The summer cottage has three bedrooms and the winter cottage has four, with uninterrupted views of the sea . Smugglers Cottage is located just a few miles from some of the series’ filming locations, including nearby St Agnes Head, which doubles as Nampara Valley, part of the Poldark family estate, in the show. There are lots of 'Poldark experiences' now on offer in the county – with kayak, horseback and walking Poldark tours. Mr Standen added: ‘I certainly think the Poldark series has heightened Cornwall's appeal. There are lots of 'Poldark experiences' now on offer in the county – with kayak, horseback and walking Poldark tours . Smugglers Cottage is located just a few miles from some of the series’ filming locations, including nearby St Agnes Head . The show’s popularity is coupled with the county’s stunning scenery and history in making Cornwall a desirable destination . ‘There are more people coming down here more regularly and expressing interest in buying a second home. ‘Properties on the coastline with these breathtaking views have got a lot of appeal and are incredibly popular, which the series has made people more aware of.’ The show’s popularity is coupled with the county’s stunning scenery and history in making Cornwall a desirable destination. Estate agents said they have seen an increase in interest in holiday homes in Cornwall since Poldark began airing last month . Smuggling was rife in the 18th century, when Poldark is set, and Cornwall's coast is full of hidden coves and tucked-away inlets. It was popular with smugglers because it had a long expanse of rocky, virtually uninhabited coast. With few revenue men to patrol it, goods like tea, brandy, rum and tobacco were smuggled in. All four of Fowey's public toilets are out of service just weeks before summer . Poldark fans and thousands of other holidaymakers who are planning to visit a popular seaside town in Cornwall may have nowhere to go when nature calls. Located in the heart of Poldark country, the town of Fowey is locked in a bizarre and long-running wrangle over public toilets. All four of the main public conveniences in Fowey – where a Poldark exhibition is being planned in May – are closed and with the summer tourist season fast approaching, there’s no sign of the wee wrangle being resolved. The town council agreed to take over the running of the four public toilets from Cornwall Council at the start of 2013. But more than two years later, the details of the transfer of ownership of three of them - Caffa Mill, the main car park and Readymoney Cove – are still being worked out by the county council while the fourth block, at the Town Quay, is shut for refurbishment. Town clerk Sally Vincent said: ‘There is nothing more the town council can do to push it on... it is still in the legal loop. ‘I am hopeful it will be completed soon. ‘The town council is really pleased to be able to take on the ownership of the toilets. ‘As a town council we feel we need to get the Town Quay toilets up and running and then go from there. It's important that Fowey has these facilities.’ The Town Quay toilets were already owned by the town council but leased to Cornwall Council, which has meant the handover could be completed more quickly. Refurbishment work started last week and it is hoped they will be open within eight weeks, with the toilet for the disabled being available to use while work is done on the others. When they reopen, visitors will have to pay 20p per use to offset the cost to the town council of running them. Mrs Vincent added: ‘The cost of running toilets is astronomical. ‘The town council simply doesn't have the money to do it for nothing so it was felt that if we charge 20p it would be something towards it.’ Cornwall Council figures suggest it will cost a minimum of £26,000 a year to run the four sets of toilets, with the town having to cover insurance costs and business rates as well as cleaning, maintenance and consumables. Until the transfer of ownership on the three blocks at the main car park, Readymoney Cove and Caffa Mill, is completed, the responsibility for opening the toilets will rest with Cornwall Council.","Interest in the hit BBC series Poldark has given Cornwall's tourism and housing market a boost .

The donor, who is known to church officials but has asked not to be named, sent the money along with a note, saying they wanted to help safeguard the church 'for the next hundred years'. The cash will be put towards the Abbey's restoration fund, which is aiming to raise £20million to repair the collapsing floor, fit heating powered by the Bath springs, and expand the building. A mysterious benefactor posted the plain brown envelope to officials at Bath Abbey, pledging £1.5million to the church's £20million restoration fund . Laura Brown, who is heading up the Footprint restoration project, said she had to read the letter twice before she could believe it was real, adding that she had to have a 'sit down' afterwards . The donation was accompanied by a note, which reads: 'Much impressed by the care and the consultation with has been put in by the Abbey, which is such a vital part of Bath’s future. 'This generation has a solemn duty to ensure the Abbey is fit and able to carry out its service to the city and the community for the next hundred years.' The church has been granted £10.4million of Heritage Lottery Funding, but only provided they can raise the additional £7.1million themselves by the end of the year.

Laura Brown, 48, who is heading up the Footprint project, told MailOnline: 'We received it in the post, just like any normal letter, and it was in a plain brown envelope just like any normal letter. 'Your first thought is ""no, hang on, that can't be right"" but then you read it again and realise, this is actually happening. I had to have a sit down for a while. 'Of course there is gratitude, but there's also this glow you get. The team believe in this project so much and it feels so good to see that someone else sees the same thing. 'Not only that but that person has the resources to be able to really make something happen, and hopefully inspire other people as well.' She added that the church still needs to raise £4.1million in the next eight months, but that cash donations have already started arriving, and more people are also pledging money. Part of the Bath Abbey rennovations will see it fitted with an eco-friendly underfloor heating system which uses water from the River Avon, warmed by the town's springs . Speaking after the first £1.1million was donated, Reverend Prebendary Edward Mason, said: 'It’s wonderful, what a remarkable group of people. 'Less than six months ago, the Abbey invited its members to consider the Footprint project by pledging gifts. 'In this short space of time, the total raised has risen to £1.1 million, an amazing response.

220,6559748e1c5dac470776d1ffc842973830d81da7,"Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme. They're accused of reaping more than $31 million in a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns to investors from funding loans to cash-strapped pro athletes. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges Monday against William D. Allen, Susan Daub and their Capital Financial Partners investment firms. Allen, 36, was a cornerback in the NFL from 2001 to 2012, playing for the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins. Accused: Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme (file photo) He was signed by the New England Patriots in March 2012 but was placed on injured reserve the following August, and he left football in March 2013. Daub, 54, is a financial professional who also lives in Florida, according to the SEC. The SEC said Allen and Daub paid about $20 million to investors but received only around $13 million in loan repayments from athletes. To make up the gap they paid investors with other investors' money rather than actual profits on the investments, in a classic Ponzi scheme, the agency said. The SEC said Allen and Daub misled investors about the terms and even the existence of some of the loans, telling them they could receive interest on the loans of up to 18 percent from the athletes. The pair used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures, the agency alleged. The SEC's criminal complaint quoted the website for Capital Financial as saying 'In many cases, athletes' contracts do not allow them to access their guaranteed money during the off season or early in the season when they may need a significant sum to purchase a house or car, pay the bills, or meet a financial demand. 'By pooling the resources of a network of investors, CFP gives athletes access to money when they need it while providing investors with solid, short-term returns on investment.' The SEC said its lawsuit against Allen and Daub was filed under seal in federal court in Boston last week and unsealed on Sunday. The agency won an asset freeze against them from the court last week. Two of their firms are based in Boston. Scam: The SEC alleges that Allen and his business partner Susan Daub used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures (file photo) The SEC is seeking an injunction against Allen and Daub and the firms, as well as unspecified penalties and restitution of allegedly ill-gotten gains. Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's regional office in Boston, said in a statement: 'The defendants sold investors on the idea of lending money to pro athletes, but we allege that’s not where a large portion of the investors’ money went. 'As in any Ponzi scheme, the appearance of a successful investment was only an illusion sustained by lies.' The telephone wasn't answered at a listing for Will D. Allen in Davie, Fla., where Allen is said to live. A person answering the phone at Daub's home said there was no comment. They are not represented in the case by attorneys, according to the SEC.","Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner Susan Daub are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators .

The 60-year-old is facing charges over the funding of his failed 2012 bid to retain the presidency of the country. Images of Sarkozy arriving at a specialist financial court in Paris today are a huge embarrassment for a politician who still thinks he can return to power. Slinking back into public view: Nicolas Sarkozy is driven to court where he faces charges over the funding of his failed 2012 bid to retain the presidency of the country - two days after being heralded as France's saviour . Thierry Herzog, the lawyer of the former French President and current head of the right-wing UMP opposition party, arrives at the Pole Financier headquarters (the fraud section of the courthouse) in Paris . Not only was he roundly beaten by Francois Hollande, his detested Socialist rival, but he is alleged to have got the UMP party to pay off his personal fine approaching £500,000 for over-spending. Under French electoral law, Sarkozy should have paid the fine himself from his own funds. On Sunday, his party made massive electoral gains against the Socialists in regional elections, and Sarkozy is convinced he can become president again in 2017. After the UMP won 66 out of 101 departments - the French equivalent of counties - Sarkozy announced: 'The French have massively rejected the policies of Francois Hollande and his government.

Within days of leaving the Elysee Palace in 2012, the Paris home he shares with his third wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni, was raided by police. He is facing criminal charges in numerous cases, including an investigation into more than £15million of false billing by Bygmalion, an events-organising company, during the 2012 campaign. It has also been alleged that Sarkozy's successful 2007 presidential campaign was funded by millions of pounds worth of illegal cash from Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, the late Libyan dictator.

The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines. He spent the early part of his career boxing in the Far East before being given his chance on the big stage in 2001 against Lehlo Ledwaba in an IBF world super-bantamweight title fight in Las Vegas.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss  against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival.

A thief who tricked his way into students' homes to steal their belongings was caught when he left his old police charge sheet behind which had his name written on it. Ricky Woolaston, 35, posed as a university maintenance engineer to gain access to students' properties before pinching laptops and mobile phones to feed his drug habit. But a court heard he was easily tracked down by police after he left behind his bag at the scene of one of the crimes. Officers searched the rucksack and found it contained a police charge sheet from a previous offence bearing his name and address. The prolific thief was arrested last Friday, and has now been sentenced to four years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to five burglaries. The court heard unemployed Woolaston would walk around the University of Birmingham campus wearing clothes bearing the red-brick university's logo. But he was caught out when he broke into the Biosciences Department on January 29 where he forced open two secure metal cupboards. Nothing was stolen but Woolaston, from Erdington, Birmingham, left behind the bag containing the charge sheet. Police were then able to pin four other burglaries on him with the help of students who  positively identified him. After the case, Detective Constable Jon Green, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Woolaston targeted students at Birmingham University in order to feed his drug habit. However, Woolaston was caught after breaking into the University's bio-sciences lab and leaving behind a bag containing a previous police charge sheet, with his name and address written on it . 'He wore a University of Birmingham top and pretended to be a maintenance engineer in order to enter the student flats and steal electrical goods. 'Unfortunately for him, Woolaston managed to leave vital evidence behind at one of the break-ins, and we are grateful to vigilant students who were able to identify him for further burglaries. 'Woolaston was charged with a total of five offences, and asked for a further five burglaries to be taken into consideration. We are happy with his sentence.'","Ricky Woolaston, 35, posed as engineer to break into students' homes .

However despite the fox’s best efforts to capture the Canadian goose - it only came away with a single feather. The action-packed photographs were captured by Roger Byng, 67, on the Wetlands surrounding the Severn estuary in Slimbridge, Gloucester. Lunch! The hungry fox races across the grass towards the large Canada goose... Launch! He is poised to take off as his startled prey takes flight ... Mr Byng, from Bristol, was in a hide ‘with the intention of photographing small British birds, such as Bullfinches, Long-tailed Tits and Wrens as part of a relaxing day’s photography.’ However Mr Byng’s relaxing day’s photography came to an explosive end after he noticed a charging fox out of the corner of his eye. ‘I suddenly saw it break into a run towards the geese so I quickly moved my camera and lens to focus on the fox,’ explained the married Grandfather-of-nine. ‘I had no time to change any settings on my camera but managed to capture the action as he tried to take down the goose.’ Gotcha! The fox leaps but his jaws snap shut a fraction too late to bring down the bird . Escape: The goose manages to take flight leaving the hungry fox in its wake . The retired security installer described how the fox came so close to what surely would be a grand catch for an animal that is roughly the same size as its prey. ‘The fox was on a search for food, evidently being hungry enough to tackle a large goose. ‘It broke into a run in an effort to take one of the geese, who at the last moment caught sight of his approach. ‘Whilst one of the geese clears the grass and rises into the air quite quickly, the other one was slower to rise enabling the fox to get close. Spitting feathers! The unsuccessful fox drops back down to earth . ‘It jumped into the air to make a grab, with jaws open and teeth displayed. It is the good fortune of the goose that he gained just sufficient height that the fox was only able to get a bite on his tail feathers. ‘The fox came away with a single feather, whilst the goose escaped with a squawk!’ The wetlands that the pictures were taken on are managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and can be accessed by paying a small fee or by taking out an annual membership granting you entry to all of the sites in the UK. Mr Byng adds: ‘Slimbridge is a wonderful location for witnessing the activity of a large number of birds and wildlife, including migratory species such as Bewick Swans.’","Photos capture spectacular moment goose narrowly avoids fox's jaw .

226,cb18c3297cbc35372f3b84990696ff75146519cb,"Caller ID as we know it could be getting a revamp. Facebook has launched a new app called Hello designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers. Scroll down for video . Facebook has launched a new app called Hello (pictured) designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers . The free app is currently in testing and is only available on Android devices in the US. It is expected to roll out to other regions and devices if testing is successful. 'Billions of calls are made everyday on mobile phones and people often have very little information about who’s calling them,' explained Facebook's product manager Andrea Vaccari in a blog post. Facebook has tweaked its News Feed setting to make posts from friends more prominent. The rules about seeing multiple posts from the same person in a row have been relaxed to show more from friends. Content posted directly by friends who people interact with more or have a direct relationship with will now appear higher up  in News Feed so they are less likely to miss it. The latest update will also make posts and Pages that friends have liked and commented on appear lower down. Facebook said: 'The goal of News Feed is to show you the content that matters to you. 'This means we need to give you the right mix of updates from friends and businesses. 'This balance is different for everyone [and] as more people and pages are sharing more content, we need to keep improving News Feed to get this balance right.' 'Today we are starting to test Hello, a new app built by the Messenger team. 'Hello connects with Facebook so you can see who’s calling, block unwanted calls and search for people and places.' When a user receives a call, Hello shows them info about who’s calling, even if they don’t have that number saved. Users will only see information that people have already shared on Facebook, and not everyone links their mobile number to their account so this could be the app's downfall. Callers must also have a Facebook account in order for the data to be shared but they don't necessarily have to be logged in at the time of the call. They also don't need to have Hello installed, either. Another feature of Hello includes making it easier to block unwanted calls. From the settings menu in Hello people can block specific numbers and adjust whether they want to automatically block calls from commonly blocked numbers. This is useful for blocking company phone numbers or spam callers, for example, and blocked calls go straight to voicemail. When a user receives a call Hello shows them info about who’s calling, even if they don’t have that number saved (pictured left). Hello also makes it easier to block unwanted calls and see which numbers have been blocked from other users (pictured right) in the app's settings menu . The list of blocked calls can also be reviewed in the recent calls list. If a call is made and the number isn't linked to a Facebook account,  Hello simply shows the number like a traditional caller ID. However, if other users have blocked this number the number of times it has been blocked is also shown. Elsewhere, when users search for people and businesses on Facebook they can call them with  one tap when Hello is installed. And in the case of searching for businesses, Hello will also show opening hours and web addresses where possible, on the user's screen.","When a user receives a call, Hello will show them info about who’s calling .

227,47b2ad590d29f766eb0f6e114ababb53e4e7cf50,"(CNN)The night before her daughter's first triathlon, Kate Parker could tell the child was nervous. Ella and her younger sister, Alice, are athletic, loud, curious, wild-haired kids. They grew up watching their mother compete in races and Ella had asked to sign up for her own. Still, as they laid out everything she'd need the next day, Parker, a photographer, could tell she was afraid. ""Why don't we get a picture?"" Parker asked Ella, now 9. ""Show me your strongest face, show me your bravest face, even if you don't feel that way right now."" As she pulled the image up on her screen, she got chills from her daughter's direct stare. She looked, Parker said, like ""a little badass."" ""You're going to be totally fine,"" Parker showed her. ""Look at how tough you are."" The next day, Ella participated in her race, and loved it. Looking back, ""I wanted her to remember that she was scared and she went through with it, sort of as a memento of her conquering a fear, "" said Parker, who lives near Atlanta. ""As a mom, I really wanted to get a good picture of it, too."" The photo is one of Parker's favorites from her series, ""Strong is the New Pretty."" It covers the last two years, but evolved from Parker's early days behind a camera, when she shot daily images of her girls to expand her knowledge of lighting and composition. It seemed that most images of little girls showcased perfectly placed hair bows, forced smiles and Photoshop-smooth skin. Hers didn't. ""I didn't want to shoot pictures like that. I didn't want girls to think they had to look like that,"" said Parker, whose daughters are now 6 and 9. ""Whoever they were, however they were, was worthy of an image. Whatever they were was good enough."" So, she shot her girls and their friends as they were -- freckled, muddy, screaming, laughing, jumping in the pool, collecting worms in the creek, barreling into the wilderness of early adolescence on skateboards and bicycles. ""I want to capture them before they lose that sense of 'I'm so awesome.' I wanted them to keep that as long as they could,"" Parker said. ""I started to shoot with that in mind, but it was already there."" The girls pose for an occasional portrait, but most are kid-inspired moments, shaped by childish wonderment and energy. As parents, Parker and her husband encourage their girls to play outside, make new friends and try new things without worrying about grass-stained knees and knots in their hair, Parker said. Now, the girls have the confidence and curiosity to do it on their own. ""They're just being themselves, and I'm just recording it,"" Parker said. Responses to the images are mostly positive, Parker said, but there's the occasional complaint that she's showing just one type of girl. It's true, Parker said: They're the ones she's raising, the only ones whose adventures she can document 24/7. She hopes the project inspires parents to find their own creative ways to capture their children's lives. More important, she wants kids to see they can be strong in whatever they are and whatever they hope to be. Parker's own kids still surprise her. ""Alice is a beautiful singer. When I hear her sing, it makes me cry,"" Parker said. ""Ella has this amazing, kind heart that cares more about the experience than the win. It's something that I did not teach her. ""Whatever it is, it's OK.""","Kate Parker is the photographer and mother behind ""Strong is the New Pretty""

Rangers won 4-1 at the 10-man Baggies on Saturday to end a losing run of five matches and clinch just their second away victory of the season. Chris Ramsey's side are still in the Barclays Premier League drop zone but are just three points behind fellow strugglers Aston Villa, who they travel to on Tuesday, with a better goal difference. Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton believes his side have a 'hell of a chance' of staying up . Barton, who scored at The Hawthorns, captained his side to a 4-1 away win against West Brom . QPR are just a point behind 17th-placed Sunderland . And Barton, who scored Rangers' fourth, is eyeing a late run which can take them to safety. 'We took our chances and hopefully it's a springboard for us to put a run together and make it difficult for the teams in and around the relegation zone,' he told the club's official website. 'There's a great amount of spirit in the group, a lot of people have written us off and we have an awful lot of work to do but performances like that give us a hell of a chance. 'We have been putting great performances in but we haven't got the rub of the green you need.' Bobby Zamora (left) scored QPR's third goal with an astounding lob from a narrow angle against West Brom . Eduardo Vargas (left) wheels away to celebrate firing QPR into the lead against West Brom . Eduardo Vargas, Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora scored to put Rangers 3-0 up at the break with Zamora netting a fabulous lob just before half time. Zamora told the club's official site: 'I'm delighted to get on the scoresheet but it was a great performance from us. Villa have lost and Leicester have won so it's tight down there and we have to keep doing our job. It's a big game on Tuesday.' Albion are eight points clear of Rangers but suffered their heaviest defeat under Tony Pulis, despite Victor Anichebe's second-half header, and also had Youssouf Mulumbu sent off. Pulis added: 'We should have dealt better with their first goal. The second goal was from a set play. Zamora scored a great third goal and the fourth goal shouldn't have stood because Charlie Austin tripped Gareth McAuley. That was a poor decision by the referee.'","Queens Park Rangers strode to a 4-1 victory against the Baggies .

Rajee Narinesingh was one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, who performed illegal plastic surgeries using substances such as Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil. Rajee had Morris inject her cheeks, lips and chin back in 2005, and ended up disfigured after she did not have the money to go to a proper cosmetic surgeon. Scroll down for videos . Rajee Narinesingh (above), one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend . Rajee was recently treated by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif in a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched . Left with a 'hard-as-rock' face, Rajee began seeing Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery in 2012, who gave her softening injections and laser therapy to treat the botched surgery. In a 2014 interview she said that her new look was helping to boost her self-esteem, and that men were taking notice. 'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon,' she said at the time. 'I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.' Now, she has had her look improved once again by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched. Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, explained when she realized she was a woman in that 2014 interview. She explained; 'Up until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy. 'When I used to fantasize about being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina. I didn't realize I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. One day I just connected all the dots and thought ""you're not gay, you're transgender.""' Rajee lived in solitude and was afraid to go out after her face was left disfigured (above) That all changed in 2012 when she began receiving free treatments from Dr John Martin . Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, claims she paid just $100 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005. 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' she said of her decision to get the injections. 'If you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction. 'So I made the choice to get injections done. In our community it is called pumping.' And while she knew she was not seeing a licensed surgeon, she was still excited the day she went to see Morris. 'When it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be,' she said. 'There was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures.' The room looked sterile and clean she said, and sokn after she arrived they began the procedure. 'I got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially I was fine,' said Rajee. 'But then the nightmare started.' 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' Rajee (above) said of her decision to get the injections. Oneal Ron Morris (above, file photo) is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue and Fix-A-Flat . She was left with a large boil on her face that kept growing bigger and bigger, and then 'green pus exploded out of my face and onto the mirror. It was green and yellow and mixed with blood.' She ended up spending years in solitude as a result of these botched procedures, until Dr Martin agreed to help her for free. Because of him, she says she has gone from 'victim to victorious.' She is also ready to start dating again, saying; 'I definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window.' As for Morris, she is now facing manslaughter charges after one of her patients died following a procedure.","Rajee Narinesingh, one of the victims of 'toxic tush doctor 'Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend .

231,ec658fd1ef60b242f24cbc30f6be227798eec268,"Ferrari technical director James Allison believes Mercedes are again likely to lead the way in China this weekend. Fears of another season of domination from Mercedes were blown away by a shock, yet deserved victory for Sebastian Vettel last time out in Malaysia. It was the Maranello marque's first success for almost two years and at least offered hope to neutrals that reigning champion Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg will not have it all their own way. Sebastian Vettel won the second race of the season with victory in Malaysia last month . Vettel saw off the challenge from Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in Malaysia . In searing heat and high track temperatures the Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen were far kinder on their tyres, stopping only twice compared to the three trips to the pits for Hamilton and Rosberg. This weekend's race at the Shanghai International Circuit, however, should favour Mercedes given the cooler climes than that of Sepang. Allison is certainly not expecting back-to-back Ferrari wins and said: 'Our car has a pretty decent cooling package. 'That allowed us to operate in the fierce temperatures like we experienced in Malaysia without having to open up the car. 'The track was also rough and hot, which is hard for tyres, and we're fortunate the car goes well on its tyres. Hamilton celebrates his win in Australia . 'Quite what problems were going on in Merc-land I don't know. 'But I'm fairly sure we will have our work cut out in China to do as impressive a job as we did in Malaysia.' As to whether Ferrari can stay the course with Mercedes and provide a season-long challenge, for now that is too difficult to determine. 'I don't know about that. I'll tell you at the end of the season,' remarked Allison with a smile. 'In Melbourne (the season-opening Australian Grand Prix) Mercedes were very, very dominant, and we were better than we looked. 'Even in free air we wouldn't have held a candle to them there. 'There is a lot of work for us to do before we can head into every race weekend confident we can hunt for the victory from the first session of that weekend. 'But we do have a fairly exciting development plan, and we've a lot of performance to bring. 'It should at least be an interesting season to see if we can close that gap so we are genuine contenders at any weekend.' Crucially, and what may yet be a determining factor, Allison added: 'Normally over the course of a season being kind to your tyres is the best thing you can be.'","Ferrari won the second grand prix of the season in Malaysia .

233,dc92076d85c3317f5b90519832b1fc3fbdc99a15,"Marion 'Suge' Knight has been rushed to hospital for an unspecified medical emergency after a judge ruled on Thursday that he will stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges. The former rap music mogul struck two men with his pickup truck in January, killing one and seriously injuring the other. Los Angeles sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida says Knight was transported to a hospital from the downtown courthouse. She says no further details could be released. Scroll down for video . 'Suge' Knight, pictured above on April 8, will stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges following a hit-and-run, an LA judge said on Thursday . The parents of Suge Knight (pictured left) and his girlfriend (right) comfort each other outside the Los Angeles courthouse after learning on Thursday that he will stand trial for murder . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen made the ruling on Thursday after concluding a hearing that focused heavily on testimony from Cle 'Bone' Sloan, who was hit outside a Compton burger stand in Los Angeles county. The judge also reduced bail from $25 million to $10 million. On Thursday morning, Knight walked out of court after the hearing. A message sent to Knight’s attorney Matt Fletcher wasn’t immediately returned. Sloan told detectives that he attacked Knight but testified on Monday that he didn't remember the fight and did not want to be a 'snitch'. Prosecutors played Sloan's statement to police, which offered a lucid, detailed account of the events on January 29 that led up to the deadly encounter. Authorities contend Knight intentionally hit the men, killing Terry Carter, 55. Suge Knight's parents seen leaving the courthouse in Los Angeles on Thursday after a judge ruled that their son will stand trial for murder and attempted murder . Victim Terry Carter's eldest daughter seen leaving court with attorney Carl Douglas after the announcement that Marion Suge Knight will stand trial for murder and attempted murder on Thursday . Knight's attorney, Matt Fletcher, said his client was ambushed and was trying to escape Sloan's attack when he ran over the men. Sloan's testimony demonstrated the difficulty in prosecuting Knight, who has gang ties and a reputation for intimidating witnesses. 'I will not be used to send Suge Knight to prison,' Sloan testified, adding that he was only on the stand because he was subpoenaed. Prosecutors granted Sloan, a former gang member who's known Knight for decades, limited immunity after he said he intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. Knight, 49, was a key player in the gangster rap scene that flourished in the 1990s, and his label once listed Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg among its artists. Knight lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy. Sloan, an adviser on the upcoming film 'Straight Outta Compton,' said he was trying to forget details of the crash, in which he suffered two fractured ankles, a serious cut to his head, two torn knee ligaments and a shoulder injury. 'Every day, I try to forget it,' Sloan said. 'I just know, I screwed up, and Terry's dead.' Sloan's memory troubles prompted the judge to comment on his testimony: 'I find that this witness is being deceptive.' The judge also heard from the lead detective investigating the case and watched security camera footage of the crash. Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs -  at one hearing in March, a medical condition sent him to the hospital . The camera caught a limited view of the parking lot but shows Knight struggling with Sloan through the window of his truck before putting the vehicle in reverse, striking Sloan, then hitting him again and running over Carter while fleeing the scene. Fletcher, Knight's attorney, pressed Sloan on his feelings toward Knight and whether he was 'enraged' at him on the day of the crash. Sloan said he was mad but disputed that he told detectives he was enraged. Fletcher also painted Sloan as the aggressor, saying Knight 'hadn't attacked you in any form, fashion or manner. You agree?' 'Yes,' Sloan said. Knight faces up to life in prison if convicted in the case. He has prior felony convictions for armed robbery and assault with a gun. Knight pleaded no contest in 1995 and was sentenced to five years' probation in an assault on two rap entertainers at a Hollywood recording studio in 1992. The rap figure was sentenced to prison in February 1997 for violating terms of that probation by taking part in a fight at a Las Vegas hotel hours before Shakur was fatally wounded in a drive-by attack as he rode in Knight's car near the Strip. Shakur's slaying remains unsolved. Prosecutors only had to present a fraction of their evidence against Knight during the preliminary hearing that began on Monday. Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs - he fired one set of attorneys during a hearing and medical conditions sent him to the hospital four times from courthouse appearances. He complained earlier this month when deputies brought him into court handcuffed to a wheelchair and has detailed health woes, including weight loss and blindness in one eye, when he's been allowed to speak in court.

Villagers in the small country hamlet of Cledford, near Middlewich in Cheshire, had vehemently opposed the plans saying that travellers could 'intimidate' nearby pensioners and may ruin the idyllic surroundings. But yesterday, Cheshire East Council gave the proposal the go ahead at a planning meeting, which will create a 'transit site' with room for nine gipsy families. The 200-year-old Cledford Hall in the small hamlet of Cledford in Cheshire which is being knocked down to make way for a 'Butlins-style' gipsy camp costing £3.2million . People living in the village have reacted with fury about the plans saying travellers could intimidate nearby pensioners . The mansion's Grade-II listed adjoining barn will be converted into 'washing and toilet' facilities and office accommodation for a resident warden will also be provided at the expense of taxpayers. The cost of the project, revealed through a Freedom of Information request, has left locals stunned, and they now fear their picturesque cottages will be left worthless as they contemplate selling up and leaving the area. Formerly Grade II-listed Cledford Hall, which dates back to 1822, was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its listing was cancelled. It will be fully demolished to make way for the site which will house gypsy families for a maximum of 28 days before they must move on. Around 100 letters of opposition were handed to the council alongside a petition comprising 500 signatures but they will continue with the plans - which also include a play area - in efforts to put a stop to ‘unauthorised encampments’. The £3.2million cost of the project was only revealed through a Freedom of Information request and got the go ahead yesterday by Cheshire East Council . Cledford Hall, which dates back to 1822, was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its Grade-II listing was cancelled . Builder Bob Moody, 66, bought a ‘dream’ retirement cottage with his wife Trisha, 61, and has spent £130,000 renovating it with original Victorian fittings. It now lies, almost finished, at the site’s entrance but he is refusing to move into it and fears he could lose £100,000 if it is put on the market. He said: 'We’re totally gutted. We’re not going to live there now. Can we sell it? It’s going to be so hard to sell. We honestly don’t know what to do. 'Most of my life savings have gone into this cottage. Do we chop the price to half of what it was worth or do we sit on it? Would anybody want to rent it from opposite a gypsy site? 'We were so confident we were going to get somewhere in that meeting because we had strong arguments especially in regards to fire safety, as the plans put the caravans too close together which flouts regulations. Builder Bob Moody at the gates to the site with local residents Ken Roden and George Beevers. He says he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting . Mr Moody beside the house he bought in Cledford as a retirement home. He is refusing to move into the property and fears he could lose £100,000 if it is put on the market . 'If they have to be three metres apart they may have to reduce the number of caravans. That means they could be spending up to £5million to accommodate six to eight families. It’s ludicrous. 'These types of transit families in Cheshire can be obstructive, they may fight with police, defecate in hedges, leave rubbish everywhere. These are not the sort of neighbours that OAPs want opposite them.' At the planning meeting, the strategic planning board of Cheshire East Council had eight votes in favour of the site, with one against. Three members abstained from voting. Residents also raised concerns that the new site would destroy local wildlife which had settled on the site of Cledford Hall, including grass snakes, hedgehogs and toads. A planning permission sign next to Cledford Hall. Cheshire East Council say the development is needed to house travellers in the area . Mr Moody added: 'None of us can understand why the council should think it necessary to spend such a large amount of money providing a luxury Butlin’s-style holiday camp for travellers in such lovely countryside. 'There could be a minimum of between 80 and 100 gypsies and travellers at any time. Some may be very pleasant and law abiding, but you will always get the few who aren’t. 'They are only allowed to stay for 28 days so you can’t form a relationship with these people. If we get the odd ones that fight and get drunk and cause trouble it will be very intimidating.' Mr Moody explained he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting. He added: 'I’m going to talk to a lawyer to see if there is any way we can get compensation. 'It is the direct action of Cheshire East Council that has lost me nearly £100,000 and I can’t recover that cost. 'This has totally ruined my retirement and retirement plans. I haven’t set a date for my retirement now because our dream was to go to our little idyllic comfortable country cottage in the fields of Cheshire and that’s been shattered now.' Building work on the site is due to go ahead in the near future since the passing of the final stage of the application. Councillor Don Stockton, head of housing and jobs for Cheshire East Council who lives in the nearby town of Alderley Edge and was part of the applying team, said: 'We need a site somewhere in Cheshire East as we have a lot of travellers in the area and have had a lot of unapproved sites where travellers have been and we have not been able to move them. 'This is an approved site which we have investigated and compared with many others across the borough. It is very difficult to get these things sited and there has been plenty of public opposition. 'I know there has been a lot of public angst and people haven’t liked it but I’m afraid that is going to be the case wherever you would wish to put a transit site. 'I do feel sorry for the nearby residents. I think if the site was on my doorstep it’s just a case if wherever these things are sited it is bound to have opposition. 'It wouldn’t matter whether it was next to my house or anyone’s house. With the best will in the world we have to try and pick the best site possible. 'It’s just inevitable there is opposition and I’m very sorry for those who have a problem with that. We are under a legal obligation to have site for travellers.” Middlewich, which borders Cledford, was named the UK’s fourth most desirable place to live in a Royal Mail study last year.","Plans for site for travellers has been approved by East Cheshire Council .

The Virgin Mary Church was torched and looted by a mob, some of whom chanted against Coptic Christians and called for Egypt to become an ""Islamic state,"" one of at least 42 churches and many more businesses and homes targeted that August, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch reports. Others attacked included St. George Church in Sohag, a city south of Cairo on the Nile River, and Prince Tadros Church in Fayoum, which is southwest of Cairo, according to reports. In addition to those getting life sentences, two minors were sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds (about $1,300), Egypt's official Egynews reported. Most of those sentenced -- 52 of the 73 defendants -- were tried in absentia, with 21 already in prison, according to Egynews. Some blamed the church and other attacks on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement that backed Mohamed Morsy. Morsy became Egypt's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsy was pushed out by Egypt's military. Morsy was sentenced to 20 years in prison earlier this month after being convicted on charges related to violence outside the presidential palace in December 2012. But he was acquitted of murder in the deaths of protesters. Christian churches across Egypt stormed, torched .

Supporters from both clubs say they are 'disgusted' at the continuing rise of ticket prices, with the protest coming in the aftermath of the announcement of the Premier League's £5.14billion TV rights deal with banners held up inside and outside the ground. With tickets at the sold-out Emirates starting from £64 for the 12.45pm kick-off, protesters hope the image of empty seats around the ground will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs. Fans inside the Emirates Stadium display a banner reading: '£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket' The cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were £64, some of the highest prices in the Premier League . Supporters of both sides gathered outside the 60,000-capacity stadium before kick-off to show off banners against the rising costs of modern football. A banner inside the stadium, held between the home and away ends, read: '£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket'. Ahead of the game, Kelvin Meadows of Arsenal's Black Scarf Movement - who organised the event with Liverpool's Spirit of Shankly and Spion Kop 1906 fan groups - called ticket prices 'extortionate'. 'In the pursuit of money football has sold it's soul,' he said. 'The fans are that soul and no one cares about the match going fans. Arsenal and Liverpool fans unite outside the Emirates Stadium in a protest against ticket prices . Fans show off a banner reading 'FOOTBALL WITHOUT FANS IS NOTHING' outside the stadium before kick-off . 'We put up with late fixture changes, unreasonable kick off times and ridiculously high prices. We do it 'cos of the love of our team. 'But the tide is turning. Old rivalries are being put aside as fans from all clubs come together. Away fans help make the event but have to pay extortionate prices. Then we're told to ""sit down, shut up"".' Roy Bentham of Spirit of Shankly said: 'We want tangible reductions in line with what working class people earn. We may lose a generation or more of fans otherwise unless the footballing authorities wake up.'

238,7c97515b0e061ee4a09e7f4707852220b8f0bb1c,"(CNN)The latest outbreak of bird flu -- the worst in the U.S. since the 1980s -- is not a likely threat to humans, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But as with any potential threat to human health, they are preparing for the worst just in case. The CDC and the United States Department of Agriculture held a press conference Wednesday to talk about preparations. ""The risk to humans is low, our food supply is safe,"" said Dr. John Clifford, the USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer. ""We know how to address disease when we find it."" Since mid-December, 16 states have seen bird flu turn up in commercial poultry, backyard chickens, and in flocks of wild and captive wild birds, according to the CDC. That number will likely grow as birds with the disease fly from one state to the next. On Monday, health leaders in Iowa said more than 5 million hens would have to be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility there. In the United States, some 3.5 million birds had already been euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the USDA. Iowa has about 60 million laying hens, according to the Iowa Egg Council and is the top egg producer in the country. California and Minnesota, two of the country's top 10 egg producing states have also seen cases. The news is bad for the birds, but not for humans. The CDC considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus ""low"" according to Dr. Alicia Fry, a medical officer with the CDC national Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, Influenza Division, Epidemiology and Prevention Branch. ""That said, human infections have occurred"" with another strain of the virus, found in Africa and in Asia, so the CDC cannot rule out the possibility of human infection, Fry said. ""We are cautiously optimistic"" that it won't spread to humans, but ""we are prepared for the possibility,"" she added. They are studying the current virus and creating candidate vaccines which could be used if one were ever needed. The USDA is also working on a potential vaccine for the birds. These are typical routine public health preparedness measures. The CDC said it is also monitoring at least 100 people who have worked with sick birds. None of the workers have gotten sick themselves. Most of the people who have become infected with the other strains of the virus in Asia and Africa have had direct or prolonged contact with infected birds. The virus does not spread through people eating chickens or eggs. Birds that are sick die quickly, according to Clifford. Incubation period is three to five days generally. With turkeys, they go off their water and their feed when they are sick and become lethargic or have a condition called ""torticollis"" or ""stargazing"" he said, and they die shortly after that. Farmers also see a drop in egg production. Commercial growers have taken extra precautions to disinfect vehicle tires and any equipment that comes into contact with the birds. Workers must also disinfect their shoes and hands when they go from building to building to reduce contamination. With popular backyard birds, the USDA suggests people try and protect their animals from coming into contact with wild water fowl that may carry the virus. The CDC said, as with any evolving public health situation, they will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. The good news is the virus doesn't like warm weather or strong sunlight, according to the USDA. So the cases should go down over the summer, but they are going to monitor the situation knowing that it could come back in the Fall.","The CDC says ""the risk to humans is low,"" but, as always, they are preparing for the worst case .

But the metaphor became all too real for Stephen Gilbert when he was bitten by a dog while campaigning for re-election in Cornwall. He joked that the dog had 'unresolved anger issues' after posting a photograph online of his bloodstained hand. Lib Dem Stephen Gilbert posted this image online of his bloodied hand after being bitten by a dog on the campaign . Mr Gilbert is defending a majority of just 1,312 in St Austell and Newquay, and Lib Dem insiders today admitted the party is on course to lose at least 20 MPs on May 7. His run-in with the dog happened while canvassing this morning. The animal took a lump out of his right hand as he posted a leaflet through a letterbox. He posted a photo of his injury on Twitter. It showed him wiping away the blood with his handkerchief and the message: 'Am guessing this dog had unresolved anger issues.' But undeterred by the injury, and perhaps recognising that the Tories pose a bigger threat to his survival, he planned to return to the streets this afternoon. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said he was delivering a leaflets through doors at the time. He said: 'He was out in the constituency delivering a leaflet through a letter box when the dog bit him. It is a hazard of the job and all politicians are vulnerable to it. 'Stephen has been treated at the minor injuries unit at the local hospital this morning and has been bandaged up with a few painkillers. He will be back on the campaign trail this afternoon.' Mr Gilbert joked that the dog had 'unresolved anger issues' after posting a photograph online of his bloodstained hand . A quarter of MPs have admitted to being chased or bitten by a dog while out campaigning for re-election, a study showed earlier this month. Cornwall is a major battleground for the Lib Dems, with three seats coming under heavy fire from the Tories. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Hampshire where the Lib Dems held Eastleigh after Chris Huhne was jailed. But behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support,  to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge. Mr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.","Stephen Gilbert jokes that the dog 'unresolved anger issues' after bite .

During tense exchanges with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, the Chancellor repeatedly ducked questions about exactly how the massive cash boost would be paid for. Mr Osborne said it would come from the Conservatives’ ‘balanced plan’ for the economy, but declined to go into further detail. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne and Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman, appearing on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show . In one exchange, Mr Marr said: ‘You’ve just found an extra £8billion. All I’m asking is where does it come from? No higher taxes, extra public spending cuts? Where?’ Mr Osborne replied: 'Well it’s part of our balanced plan. And if you look over the last five years …’ But Mr Marr interjected: ‘That’s not really an answer, Chancellor.’ Harriet Harman was left squirming yesterday after ‘posh’ George Osborne revealed on the Andrew Marr show that they had attended the same £21,000-a-year private school. She went to St Paul’s Girls’ school in West London while Mr Osborne attended the boys’ school. During tense exchanges with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, the Chancellor repeatedly ducked questions about exactly how the massive cash boost would be paid for . Mr Osborne insisted, however, that the Conservatives had shown in government that they were able to make the savings necessary to deliver additional funding for the NHS. Migrants will have to pay in more than £20,000 in taxes before they receive access to the benefits system under Tory plans. Home Secretary Theresa May said the new rules would end welfare tourism and make the UK less attractive to Eastern European migrants. New arrivals will be banned from claiming benefits until they have paid into the system for four years. The plan to ensure that they have to pay £22,600 in tax and national insurance before they can claim a penny will be part of the Tory manifesto. European job hunters would be denied unemployment benefits and forced to leave within six months if they do not find work. Those who get a job would be denied in-work benefits, including council housing, for four years. They will also be refused child benefit for offspring living anywhere else in Europe. ‘We have a balanced plan to grow our economy, to make savings in government including in welfare to fund our NHS each and every year,’ he said. ‘We have to make similar savings each year that we have made for five years of this parliament but for two years. ‘We have a track record in this parliament where we found almost £8billion extra in real terms for the National Health Service in very, very difficult economic circumstances so we have proved our mettle, we have proved our ability to stand behind the National Health Service in this parliament. We can do it in the next.’ Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, who also appeared on the programme, said the promise was ‘illusory’ and that Tory spending plans represented a ‘real threat’ to the health service. ‘The reality is that the spending programme that they have put forward is a threat to cut the NHS,’ she said. ‘People know that they find it harder to see their GP since the Tories came into government, they know that they wait longer in accident and emergency and that waiting lists are starting to grow.’","During exchanges with  Marr, Chancellor repeatedly ducked questions .

The White House said today that Bernard would depart after a state dinner next month held in honor of the Japanese Prime Minister, confirming rumors that Bernard, 53, would soon exit the administration. The first lady said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy,' she added. 'Jeremy will be missed, and Barack and I wish him the very best in all of his future endeavors.' The first lady, pictured here in November 2011 with White House Social Secretary Jeremy Bernard in Hawaii, said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' Obama added, 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy' The White House did not name a replacement for Bernard, who is also the first gay man to hold the position, nor did it explain why he was leaving. Michelle Obama spoke highly of his time on staff, however, saying, 'For the last four years, Jeremy has worked tirelessly to open the doors of the White House to as many people as possible and to make each and every event in the White House one to remember, not only for Barack and me, but for the tens of thousands of guests who pass through our doors each year.' Bernard simply stated that it's been an 'honor' to serve the Obamas and lauded the first lady for welcoming 'every guest to the White House with her signature warmth, grace and style.' 'I feel so privileged to have worked for such an extraordinary President and First Lady,' his statement read. The former California resident told the Washington Post that he planned to return to The Golden States, and he's 'really looking for some time to think about what’s next and spend some quality time with Garbo, my rescue beagle.' Bernard is pictured here catching snowflakes on the Colonnade of the White House in this February 2014 photo captured by the building's official photographer. The White House today confirmed that Bernard, 53, would depart after a state dinner next month . According to a profile of Bernard in Vogue, Bernard stumbled into politics in the early '90s while waiting tables in Los Angeles. There he met a fundraiser for then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, Dave Mixner, who brought him under his wing and into Clintonland. Bernard later formed a California-based political consulting firm with his ex-boyfriend, Democratic operative Rufus Gifford, that became the vehicle for Barack Obama's West Coast fundraising during his first campaign for president. Obama rewarded Bernard for his hard work with an appointment as the White House's liaison to the National Endowment for the Humanities. He briefly served as the chief of staff to the U.S. Ambassador to France in 2010 before accepting the position of social secretary the following year with his boss' blessing. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as social secretary since February 2011, carefully avoiding the limelight, unlike his predecessor Desirée Rogers, the first African-American social secretary, who was forced out of the administration after just 13 months on the job. It was during Rogers' tenure that socialites Michaele and Tareq Salahi crashed a White House state dinner in 2009. The couple went on to start in Bravo's Real Housewives of D.C. reality TV series. No such mishaps happened during the tenure of Bernard, whose behind-the-scenes work kept the White House in shipshape during social events. His first interview since taking the job, the Vogue profile, did not hit newsstands until February of this year - his fourth anniversary as social secretary. Asked for the interview why he believes he was chosen for the job, Bernard said, 'I would imagine part of it is a trust issue. I was there from the beginning. I was a known quantity. They certainly knew that I was loyal and supportive.' This March 18 photo shows, from left to right, Jeremy Bernard, Democratic operative Karen Finney, Executive Director of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities Rachel Goslins, and former Obama administration officals Stephanie Cutter at the ELLE and HUGO BOSS Women in Washington Power List Dinner at The Residence of the German Ambassador. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as White House social secretary since February 2011 and has carefully avoiding the limelight for the better part of his tenure . Under Bernard's watch, the White House has moved from formal printed invitations for many events to an email system. It has also shed the tradition of seating husbands and wives away from each other at dinners. Bernard told Vogue his team had received 'some criticism' for departing from the traditional seating chart, but it done in accordance with the first lady's will. 'it does bring a comfort level,' he said, of husbands and wives being allowed to sit together. 'And I believe that was part of what Mrs. Obama wanted. 'It is still the White House, still very historic and traditional, but it doesn’t have to be uncomfortable.' Speaking to the Washington Post about his impeding departure, Bernard summed up his work as making 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue 'as open as possible and to grant access to as many people as possible, especially people who had never been to the house before.' 'It’s easy to fall into patterns, and what Mrs. Obama has been able to do is have an attitude that keeps it fresh,' he said. At the time of the Vogue interview, which was conducted over several months, dating back to the beginning of November even though it was not published until February, Bernard claimed not to know what his next professional move would be and said he was focusing on the last two years of the Obamas' residency in the White House. 'The good thing about this job—and perhaps the bad thing—is that I am not able to think about the future,' he said. Bernard said that a previous White House social secretary told him 'she lost sleep toward the end because people told her she would go on to do great things next, but they never told her what.' 'She warned me that I do have to start thinking about it,' he recalled. 'I know I do; I just haven’t yet. I’m sort of putting my head in the sand.'","White House said today that Jeremy Bernard would depart after a state dinner next month, confirming rumors he'd soon exit the administration .

A conman has been jailed for stealing a pensioner's entire £401,000 life savings and using it to finance his dream wedding and honeymoon. Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk, a court heard. The 58-year-old siphoned off the £400,001 fortune over an eight-year period but when he was finally arrested he told police: 'I played him.' He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Warwick Crown Court yesterday after admitting fraud and deception after the judge ignored his plea for leniency because he was 'terrified' of going to prison. Sentencing him judge Alan Parker said: 'You plainly saw him as a soft target and you used him, and used him and used him. 'You told lies, some of them beyond wicked, and always you knew he would pay up. 'You lived a lavish lifestyle at the cost of an elderly man's life savings. Society demands that you should be punished.' He told the 80-year-old a string of lies that led to the elderly chartered accountant losing his Birmingham office and was forced to put his 'beautiful' home up for sale, the court heard. Franklin stole his money after telling him his sister had died in Canada and he desperately needed to fly there. He then said his father had died and needed a loan  until he inherited £500,000 - but in fact Franklin's father had died 20 years earlier. Before his fraud was revealed he had said that bailiffs were at the door demanding money. The victim was introduced to Franklin in 2005 and agreed to lend £15,000 for refurbishments to a restaurant Franklin ran in Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire. Shocking: Franklin was jailed at Warwick Crown Court, pictured, which heard that his victim's life was made 'a disaster' because he was left without any money to buy a pint of milk . From there, Franklin fabricated sob story after sob story in an attempt to wring ever more cash from the pensioner, including tens of thousands more in loans. But Franklin, a former car dealership manager, was living the high life and even used the money for his Italian Alps wedding and honeymoon. Meanwhile the pensioner had ran out of money and endured days filled with fear. In a statement, he said the pressure had become overwhelming as Franklin's demands took over his life. 'My financial situation is a disaster,' he added. 'At times we have been so short of money to pay for basic food that we have had to search our pockets to get enough for a litre of milk.' Defending, Lee Marklew said Franklin's personal life had been destroyed by the case, and his wife had left him. 'The thought of the inevitable custodial sentence has been utterly terrifying,' he said. 'Since his arrest it has been a palpable fear which has affected the quality of his life.' But the judge ignored his plea and jailed him.","Kevin Franklin left his 80-year-old victim without any money to buy milk .

249,b882ed05925f8879660ec4f9efdcded1d5e45561,"(CNN)One year after it was perpetrated, the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in Nigeria remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend: Hundreds of teenaged girls, just finishing school, destined perhaps for significant achievement -- kidnapped, never to be seen again. ""This crime has rightly caused outrage both in Nigeria and across the world,"" the country's President-elect, Muhammadu Buhari, said Tuesday in marking the anniversary. ""Today is a time to reflect on the pain and suffering of the victims, their friends and families. Our thoughts and prayers, and that of the whole Nigerian nation, are with you today."" The girls were abducted on the night of April 14-15, 2014, in the town of Chibok, in northeastern Nigeria, about a two-hour drive from the border with Cameroon. The Government Girls Secondary School had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by Boko Haram militants, who are opposed to Western education, particularly for girls. But students from several schools had been called in to take a final exam in physics. The militants stormed the school, arriving in a convoy of trucks and buses and engaging in a gun battle with school security guards. Then they forced the girls from their dormitories, loaded them into trucks and drove them into the forest. Most have never been seen since, except in a photograph in which they sat on the ground in a semi-circle, clad in Islamic dress. They were between 16 and 18 years old. Police said the militants kidnapped 276 girls in all. About 50 managed to escape soon after they were abducted. Those who did not, it is feared, may have been raped, brutalized, enslaved and forced to convert to Islam. Their parents were stricken with grief. The world was appalled. On Twitter, a hashtag began trending and spread around the world: #BringBackOurGirls. On Tuesday, Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the face for speaking out in favor of girls' education, sent a message to the kidnapped girls. ""I am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers,"" she wrote. ""We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: We will never forget you."" One year later, a few things have changed. Each of the missing girls has had a birthday in captivity. Each is now a year older. Nigeria's current president, Goodluck Jonathan, was defeated in his campaign for re-election, in part, it is thought, because he failed to effectively combat Boko Haram. Buhari, the incoming president, has pledged an aggressive effort to wipe out the group. But much remains unchanged, as well. Boko Haram still controls swathes of northeastern Nigeria. According to UNICEF, 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the Nigerian military, civilian self-defense groups, and Boko Haram. Amnesty International says women and children continue to be abducted. And it says Boko Haram continues to kill in large numbers. Beyond that, more than 200 schoolgirls who had gathered one year ago to take their science exam are still missing.  Their families are still bereft.

Ashley Madison, an online dating agency, is betting on Europe's relaxed attitude to boost its investment when it lists shares on the stock market in London later this year. It's founder Noel Biderman, 43, who came up with the idea for the site in the 1990s when he worked as a sports attorney, wants to raise money from investors to fund a launch of its services in Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states. Scroll down for video . Noel Biderman, 43, (pictured) who is the founder of Ashley Madison - a Canadian dating website for married people - wants to raise money from British investors to fund a launch of its services elsewhere in the world . Ashley Madison, a Canadian online dating agency which boasts 'life is short, have an affair', is targeting British investors for stock shares because of the UK's supposed 'laissez faire' attitude to extra-marital affairs . With more than 34 million members worldwide, Ashley Madison claims to be the world's second-largest dating website. Only Match.com is bigger. Despite being happily married himself, father-of-two Mr Biderman, who was born in Canada, claims infidelity can actually save relationships and believes people 'use affairs to preserve their marriage'. He is a self-made multi-millionaire having successfully launched the company in Toronto before rolling it out in other major nations. Avid Life Media, the parent company of Ashley Madison, values itself at £669million ($1 billion) and had a reported revenue of £77million ($115 million) in 2014 alone - up 45 percent from the preceding year. Mr Biderman believes the website is such a success because it gives members the 'perfect affair' - helping them cheat on their partner with like-minded people and reducing their chances of getting caught in the act. He now wants to raise up to £135million ($200 million) by listing shares for Ashley Madison in London this year, to help continue its growth worldwide. It comes five years after a lack of investor appetite caused it to pull an attempt to list in Canada. Avid Life Media has 1.2million customers in the UK and 35million worldwide but was forced to scrap a flotation in Toronto in 2010 after investors weren't convinced to buy in. Mr Biderman came up with the idea for Ashley Madison in the 1990s when he was working as a sports attorney. He said he realised there was a space in the market for the site after watching stars arrange affairs . Mr Biderman claims to have been happily married to his wife Amanda for 10 years and the pair have two sons . The company hopes success in London will help it fund a launch of its services in Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states in late May or June. Membership is growing quickest in India, South Korea and Japan. Ashley Madison's website allows members to sign up without disclosing personal information such as their name, telephone number or home address. Visitors to the site are greeted by a brunette woman, who is extending her finger across her lips in a shushing gesture. She is wearing what appears to be a wedding ring. Christoph Kraemer, director of international relations for Ashley Madison said: 'It is for people who are married, who are seeking an affair and want to do so in a discreet environment. 'In Europe, we have simply got a more laissez faire attitude towards a business such as ours.' Mr Kraemer also believes the website can actually help married couples, by 'igniting a spark in their marriage'. He said: 'The response we get from our members who have actually had an affair via the website is that they feel happier, invigorated and transmit that happiness, which actually reinforces and ignites a spark in their marriage and relationships.' Avid Life Media, which is backed financially by a number of anonymous investors, owns also various other similar websites including Cougarlife.com and EstablishedMen.com. Ashley Madison's website allows members to sign up without disclosing personal information such as their name, telephone number or home address. Visitors are greeted by a brunette woman with a finger to her lips . Married father-of-two Neil Biderman, 43, (pictured) is the man behind dating website Ashley Madison . The founder of the world’s largest online dating agency for extra-marital activity which boasts ‘life is short, have an affair’ is a multi-millionaire father-of-two who claims to have been happily married for 10 years. Neil Biderman, 43, the man behind dating website Ashley Madison, has made millions from his unique website which offers married partners the chance to have an affair with other spouses. However, despite his hugely successful business, Canadian-born Mr Biderman – who is often referred to as ‘the king of infidelity’ claims he has never cheated on his wife Amanda and remains happily married. The couple have two sons. Despite his loyalty claims, Mr Biderman did once reveal that he wouldn’t hesitate to cheat if the sexual relationship with his wife dried up. Speaking to the Evening Standard last year, he said: ‘We’re incredibly communicative about our sexual needs. ‘But if I woke up beside my wife and it was the 200th day we hadn’t been intimate with one another and it looked like nothing would change, I would cheat so fast. ‘I would cheat long before I would get a divorce. If you have children that you love and a home that you built together and a future that you planned — why would you give that up just for sex?’ Mr Biderman came up with the idea for the extra-marital dating site in the 1990s, after a career as a sports attorney apparently made him realise how much time and money his clients spent on mistresses while they were away on tour. The site has made him a self-made multi-millionaire and he claims it is worth at least £669million ($1 billion). Despite its risqué nature, Mr Biderman’s wife doesn’t appear to mind because she agrees it is a ‘sound business idea’. The pair insist the social network is just a tool and no one can force anyone to betray a spouse and even believe the dating website can actually help save marriages. M Biderman said previously: ‘The reason people have affairs is that they want to stay married. ‘What I get is a lot of people who come back to me and say: 'Listen, this has made me a better partner.' ‘They were angry and taking things out on their family. The sexual frustration they were feeling, they start having the affair and all of a sudden, that stress is removed. It's very cathartic for those people. ‘If you come home and you've had an affair earlier in the day, it might be easier not to be frustrated with your partner. The conversation could take a different directional tone and that can lead to intimacy. He also has previously said: ‘My belief is that people use affairs to preserve their marriage.’","Canadian adultery website to list shares in London in bid to boost revenue .

Before and after images show how the wave of snow, ice and rock flattened the usually serene 18,000-foot-altitude base camp on Saturday. The avalanche started on Mount Kumori, a 23,000-foot-high mountain just a few miles from Everest, and gathered strength as it tore across the world's highest peak. Half an hour after the initial quake, another magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit, followed by smaller aftershocks across the region. Eighteen people died in the avalanche, including four Americans, and 61 were injured, according to Nepal's mountaineering department. Scroll down for videos .

Flattened: But on Saturday, an avalanche pummeled the campers at the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp, leaving it covered with snow . American Google executive Dan Fredinburg, 33, was the first confirmed fatality on the mountain. New Jersey-born Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed by the avalanche where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering. A third American, Tom Taplin, 61, who owned TET Films & Photography, was making a documentary when the earthquake hit, NBC News reported. His wife Corey Fryer told the station he died 'doing what he loved'. On Sunday the first survivors were flown off Everest by aid helicopters and began sharing their incredible stories of survival. Bhim Bahudar Khatri, a cook for a climbing team, said: 'I was cooking for my team in the meal tent when the earthquake hit. We all rushed out to the open and the next moment a huge wall of snow just piled on me. 'I managed to dig out of what could easily have been my grave. I wiggled and used my hands as claws to dig as much as I could. I was suffocating, I could not breathe. But I knew I had to survive. 'I dug a few more feet until I was out of the snow and could breathe. I looked around and saw the tents all torn, crushed and many people injured. I had lived, but lost many of my friends.' An Everest guide, Pemba Sherpa, 43, added: 'I was resting in my tent when the earthquake hit. I heard a big noise and the next thing I know I was swept away by the snow. I must have been swept almost 200 meters. I lost consciousness. Wreckage: People look over the scene on Saturday after the earthquake triggered the avalanche that flattened parts of the base camp .

Fight for survival: One survivor recalled 'a huge wall of snow' falling on him and how he had to claw his way out to survival . Recovery: A group is seen carrying an injured climber in their sleeping bag; more than 60 people were injured in the incident . Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest . 'When I regained consciousness, I was in a tent surrounded by foreigners. I did not know what happened or where I was.' He said the toll on Everest was sure to rise: 'There are still many people who are still missing on the mountain. There were several tents buried by the snow, several blown away.' Michael Churton, a filmmaker from New York, was with four other colleagues at the base camp when the earthquake hit, and he said that it took about 45 seconds for the avalanche to finish. 'I told the group to get down,' he said. 'It was about 4,000 feet of snow just coming and there was nowhere to run.' After curling up into a fetal position, he was thrown into a rock, which left him with cuts to his face and a black eye - but he was otherwise uninjured. Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest. Speaking from his sleeping bag at base camp on the north side of the mountain, the experienced climber said his group took cover after rocks the size of cars came crashing down around them. 'At first we could feel the trembling under the tent, but it was eerie as there was no noise, it was silent. Then it felt like we were shaking on a huge plate of jelly,' he said. 'It was so strange feeling the ground turn to jelly under our feet and we thought the mountain would start crashing down on us.' The instructor from Adventure Peaks, who was leading a group of eight clients on their first trip up the mountain, said the area was badly hit by rock falls, but they all escaped injury. Killed: Three Americans died on the mountain: Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, (left), who was working as a medic at the time, Google exec Dan Fredinburg, 33, (center with his ex-girlfriend, actress Sophia Bush) and documentary filmmaker Tom Taplin, 61 (right) Heading out: Rescuers carry a sherpa injured by the avalanche. The quake is believed to have killed more than 4,000 people . Heading home: A rescue helicopter prepares to land on Sunday and the first survivors were carried off the mountainside . 'Sure enough, an area of steep cliffs did break off sending car sized boulders hurtling down only a few hundred metres from our tents. We are still feeling aftershocks hours later. 'We were very lucky as no one in our group has been injured, but one climber was struck by a boulder.' He said their main priority was now working out how to leave base camp and make their way home, as the road to Kathmandu has been obliterated by the quake. 'We are trapped and have nowhere to go, we can't get back to Kathmandu, the road has been completely destroyed and there is absolutely no way to get through.' Climber Garrett Madison, who runs Seattle-based firm Madison Mountaineering, described how he was leading his group up the mountain when he heard the terrifying sound of avalanches. 'We heard an awful noise and heard avalanches coming down either side of the valley,' he said. 'We thought we were going to get wiped out but we were only dusted by a snow cloud. We proceeded up to Camp Two and contacted Base Camp where we heard of the awful destruction.' On Monday, it emerged that the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 4,400 people, with more than 8,000 injured. The toll is expected to rise as assessments are made in vulnerable mountain villages that have been inaccessible since the quake. Nepalese officials have speculated that the number of casualties could reach as high as 10,000.","Photographs taken after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake sparked an avalanche on Mount Everest on Saturday show the campsite buried beneath snow and belongings strewn across the mountain .

255,11a43ead0e7e502445f36c1fe69c54919064238f,"A heavily pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman  and her baby died after she was diagnosed with leukemia but refused a blood transfusion that would probably have saved both of their lives. The 28-year-old was diagnosed with the cancer seven months into her pregnancy, and doctors told her she could  give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy but both would require her to have a blood transfusion. The Sydney woman refused both options due to her religious beliefs and her baby died in utero three days later. She had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis after suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure. A pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion . Her treating haematologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Dr Giselle Kidson-Gerber, said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood. 'Her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus,' Dr Kidson-Gerber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Obviously it's a very big ethical issue. Legally in Australia the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus's behalf. 'Most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby.' Dr Kidson-Gerber added: 'If we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died.' Hospital staff were 'distressed' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths, as 83 percent of pregnant leukemia sufferers go into remission with treatment. Dr Kidson-Gerber said it was a challenge to respect a patient who refuses life-saving treatment. 'It was sad. I think that I did my best to help her. But ultimately I couldn't change the course of events,' she said. The 28-year-old had pregnancy complications due to her leukemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds . In a recent  article published in the Internal Medicine Journal about the 2009 case, Dr Kidson-Gerber and her colleague Dr Amber Biscoe wrote: 'Not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus. 'Refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected, but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial.' Sascha Callaghan, an expert in ethics and law at the University of Sydney said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. She said Jehovah's Witnesses are often condemned for their beliefs, especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions. 'This woman has a long-held commitment to the Jehovah's Witness faith and that's how she chose to die,' she told the Herald. 'When your foetus is in utero, it is inextricably tied to your life.' The woman was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Women and the Prince of Wale Hospital in Randwick . Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the Bible commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to God as the giver of life.","Jehovah's Witness and her baby have died after refusing blood transfusion .

On Tuesday, SpaceX came incredibly close to landing its Falcon 9 rocket booster on a barge in the middle of the Atlantic. Now, leaked footage reveals just how close Elon Musk's firm came to success, with a close-up view of the daring attempt shot on a GoPro camera . A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster caused by a gust of wind. The video, which appeared on Reddit, reveals how the rocket overcompensates for its extreme tilt. A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve designed to control the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster. Earlier this week SpaceX has released its own dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the Atlantic. The video, taken from a plane , shows the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before exploding on impact. The maneuver was attempted following the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket a few minutes earlier from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Soon after the launch, billionaire SpaceX founder, Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.' The unverified video shows the rocket drifting into view in slow motion and floating onto its target before a gust of wind topples it over . Pictured is the moment of impact.  A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough . Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. The autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft (90 by 30 metres), with wings that extend its width to 170ft (50 metres). Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. The Falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing and science experiments to the ISS - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts. The supplies today arrived at the ISS. The rocket was was due to take off on Monday, but the launch was  scrubbed due to bad weather. The video, taken from a plane on Tuesday, shows the the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side . On board the Dragon capsule was an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. 'We're very, very happy to have it here,' Cristoforetti radioed to mission controllers in Houston today. The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee-drinking in space. SpaceX, meanwhile, hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. The booster managed to land on the barge but Elon Musk said that 'excess lateral velocity' caused it to tip over . Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year . The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic ocean . Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions.' The Dragon — the only supply ship capable of returning items intact — will remain at the space station until around May 21. During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery of food and equipment arrived today . The launch sequence as it happened. All stages of the launch went to plan, except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand . Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed second landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. This is the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit. The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying. The Falcon Heavy is expected to make its first test flight late this year. While the booster landing didn't go to plane, the launch was successful.

With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff . Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014.","Norway's Alexander Kristoff won race after sprint finish with Niki Terpstra .

Sterling's boss Brendan Rodgers admitted after his side's dismal 4-1 defeat at Arsenal that Liverpool will have trouble attracting top players without Champions League football. He said: ‘It makes it difficult, there’s no doubt about that. Most players want to be in the Champions League. They want to play at the top level of the game and if you’re not in the Champions League it makes it difficult for you. We know that. ‘It’s going to be a little like this until we become more stable. We’ve got young players who are growing, getting more experience and then hopefully there will be a period where we qualify again. We want to be in the Champions League. That’s important and it is key for us. ‘It’s highly unlikely this year. But Liverpool is a great club. I said that before I came into it. It’s a phenomenal club that players want to play for.’","Exclusive: Zinedine Zidane has confirmed Real Madrid are keen on signing Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling .

262,94a2086707cf79ca326d032dad1e3570f9e2b38a,"A clean-water advocate took an Earth Day swim in New York City's polluted Gowanus Canal, a site designated by the federal government as especially polluted, but quit less than halfway through. Christopher Swain wore a protective yellow suit as he went over a railing and into the water around 2pm Wednesday in Brooklyn but completed only two-thirds of a mile of the 1.8-mile waterway. He swam about an hour into the canal in  a stunt to urge environmental clean up that ultimately succumbed to the water's pollution because the experience was like 'swimming 'in a dirty diaper'. Christopher Swain, a clean-water activist, embarked on a 1.8-mile swim in the toxic Gowanus Canal, which has been designated as especially polluted by the Environmental Protection Agency, to urge its cleanup . The swimmer, who quit two-thirds of a mile into the swim, gargled hydrogen peroxide periodically to prevent contaminated water from getting down his throat . Swain, who has previously swam the Hudson and Columbia Rivers, said that cleanup of the Gowanus Canal, which was labelled as a Superfund site by the EPA, should be accelerated . 'It's probably the safest move at this point,' he said, according to Reuters, but pledged to swim the whole canal one day. 'I want to make it clear, no one is telling me to stop,' Swain continued, and said that impending bad weather played a role in his decision. The activist said 'It's not safe to swim in there,' according to Gothamist. He said that the water tasted 'Like mud, poop, ground-up grass, detergent and gasoline'. The 19th-century canal was once a major transportation route, but it's now so polluted with industrial and sewer discharges that it must, by law, be cleaned up. The federal Environmental Protection Agency says contaminates include PCBs, which were banned in the US in 1979. It warned Swain against taking the swim, posting a message on its Twitter account saying that it 'strongly advises AGAINST swimming' in the strip of water. The agency issued guidelines in 2011 saying that people should 'never swim in the canal', which runs over 1½ miles through a narrow industrial zone near increasingly wealthy neighborhoods in Brooklyn. It urged anyone who came in contact with the water to seek medical attention immediately if they felt sick. Crowds gathered on bridges along the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn as Swain was accompanied by a woman in a red kayak . The activist has previously swam the Hudson River in New York and the Columbia River in Washington to bring attention to water issues . Swain waves to the crowds who came to see him swim but were disappointed when he only made it two-thirds of a mile. A baby whale once got lost in the canal in 2007 and died within two days . After heavy rainstorms excess water from the sewer system flows in the canal, where  raw sewage and human excrement that mixes into its normal mix of petroleum products and other chemicals. An estimated 377million gallons of diluted raw sewage pour into the canal each year. 'There's a lot of poop in there,' Swain said after his swim, according to the New York Post. Dissolved arsenic in the water is thought to be at a level 60 times higher than that harmful to human health. A baby whale became lost in the canal in 2007 and was nicknamed Sludgie by locals. It died in two days. After rainstorms it can often be found with raw sewage that mixes into its normal mix of petroleum products and other chemicals. However Swain, who has previously done long swims along the Hudson River in New York and the Columbia in Washington, wanted to call attention to the slow clean up of the canal and urge for it to be accelerated. An estimated 377million gallons of sewage is poured into the Gowanus Canal every year. Above, trash pollutes the Brooklyn inlet in 2013 . The pollution in the Gowanus Canal combines decades of industrial dumping and general trash. It is particularly filthy after rainstorms . He gargled hydrogen peroxide to fight against any bacteria entering his body and had charcoal tablet to take that will help if he did, according to CityLab. Swain told reporters after he got out that he did not swallow any water. He was accompanied by a woman in a kayak, paddling a few feet away from him before he called it quits. Swain posted on Twitter that swimming in the canal is his 'federal right' under the Clean Water Act of 1972. Gowanus was labeled a Superfund site in 2010, with the EPA later saying that cleaning it up would take up to ten years and $506million, according to DNA Info. Costs will mostly fall on the city and companies that used to be along the canal such as National Grid. The agency plans on beginning dredging in the canal in 2017, which involves cleaning out 600,000 cubic yards of contaminated mud. Before Wednesday's failed effort, Swain also planned on swimming other polluted waters, such as the Bronx River and Newtown Creek, which runs between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. He said he has hope that New York's polluted waterways will one day be clean enough for swimmers without protective suits. The water advocate claims that it is his 'federal right' to swim in the canal under the Clean Water Act of 1972 .

Paul Armstrong, 26, of Sunderland, flew to Cyprus with four friends before beginning his new role as an IT project manager. But after a spending spree on the trip, Armstrong was stopped at the airport with the stun gun disguised as a torch, extendable baton and knuckle duster stuffed in his luggage. A court heard how the stun gun was capable of administering an electrical discharge which would cause a victim to 'startle and repel'. Armstrong pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and two offensive weapons and lost his job before he even started it. Judge John Milford QC told Newcastle Crown Court: 'The general public need to be warned about the gravity of bringing home such souvenirs. 'What he did was foolish. It must be realised that the court takes very seriously the bringing into this country of those items. 'A stun gun is, within the legislation of this country, a firearm. It is an extremely serious offence to possess one. 'It is highly undesirable that they should be in circulation in this country.' The 26-year-old was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with £2,000 costs at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) The judge said a prison sentence was not necessary in Armstrong's case as there was no suggestion he would use the weapons, had never been in trouble before and had recently found employment. Judge Milford added: 'He had an extremely good job lined up. As a consequence of these proceedings, which he had to reveal to his perspective employers, he lost that job.' As such, Armstrong was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with £2,000 costs. Glen Gatland, defending, said; 'He has never been in trouble with the police and is of previous good character. 'He went on holiday to Cyprus with four friends (in the summer of 2013) who had been to primary school together. 'The reason he went was because he had been offered a job as IT project manager with retail branches in London and Zurich. 'He would have been moving away and not able to see his friends.' The court heard three of the friends who had been on the holiday with Armstrong received warnings after batons and knuckle dusters were found in their luggage. Mr Gatland said the weapons were bought from a 'corner shop' in Cyprus and Armstrong had been given the knuckle duster free with his other purchases.","Paul Armstrong flew to Cyprus to celebrate new job as IT project manager .

Speaking about the Terry race row for the first time since leaving his post as England manager, Capello said England would be in a much stronger position if they still had the Chelsea stalwart at their disposal. ‘I think John is England’s best defender and they have not got a lot of defenders,’ said Capello, ‘It is better to have a player like John than not have him.’ Fabio Capello insists defender John Terry should never have been stripped of the England captaincy . Capello claims England would be in a much stronger position if they still had the Chelsea star at their disposal . The Italian was in charge of the national side when Terry was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, the brother of then England teammate Rio, during a Chelsea match against QPR in October 2011. He was stripped of his captaincy by the Football Association after being charged by police. Capello resigned as England Manager in February 2012 just two days after publicly criticising the FA’s decision and obviously remains bitter about the whole affair. He believes Terry should have kept his role under the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven. ‘I fought for John to be able to come back and play but they [the Football Association] said “no you can’t decide about the player, you need to wait for the court decision,” and I said “Why?” But they had already decided before I asked. John Terry was caught up in a race controversy with then-QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in 2011 . Chelsea captain Terry, who has 78 England caps, retired from international football in September 2012 . Asked if it was time to persuade Terry, who has been a permanent fixture in the Chelsea side bound for the Premier League title, to come back into the England fold, Capello - speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards - directed his ire at the FA. ‘You know what happened with me, they decided he could not play with the national team and I didn’t understand because he was not guilty. ‘When it happened I said to the President [David Bernstein] “You decided he’s guilty?” No he’s not guilty, it’s good you can play with the national team and I don’t understand why you don’t play.’ Terry was cleared of racially abusing Ferdinand in a criminal hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court but retired from international football in September 2012 after the FA pursued their own charges. An FA hearing found Terry, who has 78 England caps, guilty of using insulting words which included a reference to Anton Ferdinand’s colour or race and he was banned for four matches and fined £220,000, . Terry, 34, said he was ‘deeply hurt’ by the incident and will never play for England again. Capello agreed his international career was probably over. ‘I don’t think he has the chances to play with the national team more,’ said Capello, ‘But I saw some young players that played with me are improving. [Chris] Smalling is playing and [Phil] Jones. I’m happy because a lot of players I put in the national team are playing now and well.’ The Chelsea defender was cleared in court of racially abusing Ferdinand but was banned and fined by the FA .","Fabio Capello believes England would be much stronger with John Terry .

266,ad11bc01823390d032d66bcece16293509cf4c45,"(CNN)This is a difficult but necessary thing to say: Incidents of police-involved killings and assaults on unarmed African-Americans are unlikely to end soon. That's partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a ""moment."" And it's also because we have not yet shown the resolve needed to end it. This is a reality we must face if we are going to reverse course from what has become a national crisis. The peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in Baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis -- as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over. The violent response of police officers to unarmed African-Americans is a decades-long phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as ""race card"" politics and black grievance. But this year's spate of killings and assaults, from Ferguson, Missouri, to North Charleston, South Carolina, to most recently Baltimore, are part of a deadly continuum of conduct that has created a well of resentment and anger in the  African-American community. So what makes now different? The advent of cell phone cameras and social media has for the first time allowed average citizens to document police brutality routinely and to disseminate these images nationally. As a result, it is no longer possible for officials and commentators to downplay or deny the existence of police brutality against unarmed African-Americans as has happened in the past. To call this ugly and unrelenting wave of police violence against unarmed African-Americans a national crisis is not an exaggeration -- we are losing the confidence of a generation of young people who no longer believe in the legitimacy or credibility of our law enforcement and the justice system that underpins it. A true democracy draws its strength from the confidence of its citizens in the bedrock institutions. The loss of that confidence threatens the very foundation of our legal system. How do we face this crisis? First, we must recognize that there are no quick fixes. The culture of policing in cities such as New York and Baltimore has developed over decades. Policing is a job passed down through families in which law enforcement norms and narratives are shared around the dinner table as much as in the station house. To subvert that culture will require vigorous, targeted and consistent training. That training must include a focus on managing implicit bias, encounters with the mentally ill and how best to de-escalate encounters with members of the community, especially young people. Training must be accompanied by supervision and accountability for officers who fail to conform their behavior to training principles. President Barack Obama is right when he reminds us that policing, like education, is a function of state and local government. And it's true that his options are limited. And yet the federal government has proven to be quite adept at influencing education policy in states and cities. How? By conditioning federal funds on compliance with federal standards. In contrast, while the Department of Justice provides more than $1 billion annually in grants to police departments across the country, those funds are provided free from obligations that awardees adopt federal standards on training, data collection or other measures with an explicit anti-racial bias focus. That must change. Also, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department must be properly funded to investigate any police departments suspected of engaging in a pattern and practice of discrimination. Such investigations doubled to more than 20 under Attorney General Eric Holder, but given the nearly 30,000 police departments spread across the country, this is woefully inadequate. It's been reported that nearly every investigation conducted by the department has resulted in a finding of a pattern and practice of discrimination. The results in places such as Seattle and Cincinnati, where the departments worked with local officials to negotiate changes to local police practices, are promising. But the $12 million currently allocated to these investigations nationwide is a shameful pittance. Much has been made of rogue police officers, ""bad apples"" and other aberrant actors in the criminal justice system. They undoubtedly exist. But the failure of local law enforcement leadership to vigorously and aggressively discipline, punish and, where appropriate, remove those officers from police forces around the country has allowed the bad apples to spoil the whole bunch. There must be zero tolerance for racism, brutality and corruption in police departments. Making this change will require law enforcement to value the integrity of the badge over the unquestioning solidarity that has too often resulted in the protection of officers who have committed egregious acts. Yet until police officers come to expect swift and certain punishment for violating their oath to protect and serve, we are unlikely to see a real decrease in incidents of racially motivated police brutality. Ultimately, the crisis we face presents an opportunity to rethink policing in this country fundamentally, including who we decide to recruit to serve. Former Baltimore Police Commissioner Leonard Hamm, for example, has told me he was always skeptical of new police recruits who expressed a desire to become narcotics or homicide detectives. That thinking reflects a spirit of adventure, he told me, rather than a spirit of service. Hamm is right -- policing is, at its core, a service profession. Those we select for this difficult and dangerous job should not only demonstrate mental toughness, courage and smarts, but also integrity, maturity, empathy and a commitment to the communities they serve. A national crisis requires a national response, and that means that federal, state and local law enforcement leaders and organizations must honestly and aggressively move to end police brutality. Until we see that kind of wholesale engagement, the lives of innocent people -- and the integrity of our legal system -- hangs in the balance.","Sherrilyn Ifill: Police violence against unarmed African-Americans is a national crisis .

267,14b4a869d0faf618c517550b2c0b03647fb3a467,"8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer . Noreen Spendlove was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal. Noreen, then 68, had the scan as part of the NHS breast cancer screening programme, and as she says: 'As always, getting the all-clear was a big relief.' But 18 months later, shortly before her 70th birthday, the mother-of-three from Derbyshire developed intermittent pain in her left side, just below her breast. And although Noreen, a former administrator, wasn't concerned, her daughter, a radiographer, insisted she see a GP. Despite finding nothing abnormal, the GP referred Noreen for a mammogram. This revealed three lumps on her left breast, which were all tumours. Noreen is adamant: 'That GP appointment saved my life.' Breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988, with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years. In 2000, the upper limit was extended to 70. 'I didn't realise it at the time, but at 68 I'd already had my last official mammogram,' says Noreen. 'It's all the more scary knowing that, because even though I check my breasts regularly, I definitely hadn't felt any lumps. Without my daughter, I wouldn't have gone to my GP.' Noreen was one of the lucky ones. MPs are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit. In a report published two weeks ago, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer pointed out that 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. And while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70. So, extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved, the MPs said. In fact, the upper age limit is due to change. From the end of 2016, all women up to 73 will be invited for screening. But critics argue this is not high enough. Nat Lievesley, a researcher at the Centre for Policy on Ageing, says this cut-off point 'seems arbitrary', adding: 'It feels like a decision based on cost rather than what's best for women.' And the parliamentary group is concerned at the 'slow pace of change'. In 2013, they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76, and possibly to 79. 'Extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved' 'While some progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care, treatment and support most appropriate to them,' says Steve Brine, the Conservative MP for Winchester and co-chair of the parliamentary group. And this ageism is not limited to access to mammograms. There's evidence older women are less likely to get certain treatment for breast cancer than younger women. In 2013, researchers at the University of Sussex said women over 70 in the UK who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is standard treatment for younger patients. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, published in the British Journal of Cancer, reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in Sweden, where screening in most of the country continues to 74. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, last year warned: 'Around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer in older women could be avoided each year in England if survival rates matched the best in Europe.' It is ‘shameful’ to write off people as too old for screening and treatment, adds Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support. ‘People should be judged on their health as an individual not just their age.’ Ending screening at 73 ‘doesn’t take account of the fact that ageing is changing’, adds Nat Lievesley. ‘It’s no longer a strong indicator of frailty. Just look at the role models for women in their 70s.’ Yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear-cut, for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment. A Dutch study, published in the BMJ in August 2014, suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in 'over- diagnosis and overtreatment'. Researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995, when breast cancer screening in the Netherlands was extended from 69 to 75. They found this had led to only a small increase in the discovery of advanced breast cancer, while the number of early-stage tumours detected increased considerably. For every woman found to have advanced cancer, another 20 would be diagnosed with small, slow-growing tumours that might not affect their life expectancy but would lead to major surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lead researcher Dr Gerrit Jan-Liefers, of Leiden University Medical Centre, said: 'The chances of older women recovering from such severe treatment is far less than for younger women.' Older women are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems alongside cancer, he pointed out. 'So it may take them a year, a year and a half before they function normally.' For Noreen Spendlove, however, there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended. After her second mammogram in March 2011, she had a needle biopsy the same day, and two weeks later a mastectomy. The cancer had spread to her neck, so she was given six sessions of chemotherapy followed by a five-week course of radiotherapy. 'The treatment was murderous,' says Noreen. But as she prepares to receive the all-clear next year, she has no regrets about having this treatment. Indeed, her worry is that, once five years since her treatment have passed, she'll no longer be automatically invited back for screening as younger cancer survivors would be. In fact, women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it's just the invitations that stop. Cancer charities warn that this gives the message that women no longer need to worry about breast cancer. Women are entitled to request mammograms at any age . An added complication is that older women are likely to be less 'breast aware' and more cautious about bothering their GP, the All-Party Parliamentary Group pointed out previously. Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, says: 'It's clear from calls to our helpline many older women believe that because they aren't being invited, they are no longer at risk.' Jackie Woods, 57, a local government officer from Forest Hill, South London, agrees this can be a problem. Her mother, Betty, celebrated her 88th birthday last month after undergoing treatment for breast cancer four years ago. Betty had diligently booked herself in for regular mammograms, despite no longer being invited for screening - but she was rare among her peers in doing so. During November 2011, Jackie was diagnosed with breast cancer after her regular mammogram. The diagnosis reminded Betty to request another scan for herself, and in June 2012 she was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer and had a mastectomy. Rather than simply ending screening, the Dutch researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good, say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman. This should be 'based on remaining life expectancy, breast cancer risk, functional status and patients' preferences', says Dr Jan-Liefers. Another way forward, says Jane Murphy, is for women to be reminded at their last screening that they are entitled to further ones. 'They should be given a card that informs them that they can continue to take advantage of regular screening. But it doesn't always happen.' Noreen Spendlove was given no such card. 'It's terrifying to think that the cancer might not have been picked up,' she says. Breast Cancer Care helpline: 0808 800 6000 or breastcancercare.org.uk.

268,008b20b1a9f3d4e35475fd50f574e8834530e620,"Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus has revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Speaking in the latest issue of Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former senator and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video . Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine . Short and sweet: Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades . Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread . As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose ideology revolves around getting 're-elected at all costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy . Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event . And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female politicians get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There’s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let’s do something about that,' she said. 'Let’s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that’s OK, and if it does look good, that’s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld. On Tuesday it was announced that she would be making an appearance on her former co-star's Crackle channel web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.","The 54-year-old actress covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine ."

Mary, 43, treated her three youngest children, Princess Isabella, seven, and twins Princess Josephine and Prince Vincent, four, to a day out at a farm in Kirke Hyllinge, a village in Zealand.

272,5a2f95702c04f6e4c4ed45c9ec19980004209fc9,"The possession police are out in force, and Jose Mourinho is the Premier League’s Most Wanted. The football purists are foaming at the mouth – how can this Portuguese pretender dare to win games without wanting the football? Is this the most negative side to ever win the title? Is this the most terrible team to lift the Champions’ crown? Woah there, just hang on a moment. Jose Mourinho has come under fire for Chelsea's lack of possession during their 1-0 win over Man United . Mourinho and his staff and players celebrate the crucial win over United on Saturday at Stamford Bridge . I’m no fan of the kind of football Chelsea played on Saturday to beat Manchester United. But at the end of the season, they are getting the job done, it’s as simple as that. And who can blame Mourinho for being so cautious? Last season they were seven points clear at the top of the table but fell away after losing at Aston Villa and Crystal Palace – both in the bottom half of the table at the time, and were beaten at home by Sunderland, who were six points adrift in 20th place. And then needing a win to go top of the Premier League with just two games to go, Mourinho watched his side draw 0-0 at home to Norwich, who were about to be relegated. The title that had been in their grasp, was lost. Chelsea’s most impressive result during that run-in was a 2-0 win at Liverpool, a game made famous by Steven Gerrard’s slip. It ended Liverpool’s 16-match unbeaten run and checked their charge to the title. That day Chelsea let Liverpool have 73 per cent possession over the 90 minutes. Chelsea found a way to win without the ball. And Mourinho did the same on Saturday to an in-form Manchester United, who had 70 per cent possession at Stamford Bridge. It’s not my kind of football – I like to see what talented professional players can do with the ball. And so does Louis van Gaal. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Steven Gerrard slips against Chelsea at Anfield last season - a game Chelsea won with only 17% possession . Ba scores as Chelsea go on to win at Anfield and effectively end Liverpool's title push last season . The Dutch master might just wonder to himself if things could have been different if he had certain individuals fit. All clubs have injuries, but for that massive game on Saturday, United needed key players in the team. It would have been fascinating to see if Van Gaal’s possession philosophy would have won the day, over the Jose way. Chelsea won the game, and they did it in typical Mourinho fashion – by not wanting possession of the football. Jose has learned a lot from his mistakes of last season. I understand his pragmatism given that Chelsea are so close to sealing the title. But he fell into this negativity way too early in the season, and it led to their abject failure in Europe. Mourinho needs to be more expansive in the Champions League next season – that’s for sure. Andre Schurrle’s goal against Burnley after a sublime pass from Cesc Fabregas was a highlight of the season . But don’t judge this Chelsea side on the Premier League run-in alone: they may not have been consistently sparkling with their style, but they have had some wonderful moments this season. On day one of the season Cesc Fabregas’ sublime disguised pass for Andre Schurrle’s goal at Burnley had us all out of our seats. It wasn’t his only example of genius since August. When fit, Diego Costa’s strength, movement and finishing have been a joy to watch. And then there’s Eden Hazard. The player Mesut Ozil, Angel di Maria, Samir Nasri and Raheem Sterling and others all dream of being. Yes some of those others have medals, but they haven’t shown the same amazing ability as the Chelsea number 10. His balance, his control, his passing and finishing have all been superb all season. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (left) dribbles with the ball ahead of Manchester Untied's Wayne Rooney (right) Oscar (second left) scores against Swansea as Chelsea run riot at the Liberty Stadium in January . And during this period when Jose Mourinho is being over-cautious, making sure they secure the title they let slip last season, Hazard has lifted the team from a blue sea of negative mediocrity, to one capable of star quality. And back in January, Chelsea gave arguably the best footballing display of the season in the Premier League when they went to Swansea and won 5-0. The one-touch football was special, and the way the three behind Costa drifted around was reminiscent of the total football played by sides born out of Rinus Michels’ Ajax and Holland sides of the 1970s. Chelsea were 4-0 in front at the break, by which time Willian had also hit the bar twice. Jose’s side completely outplayed and outpassed one of the better footballing sides in the division. So don’t be too harsh on Chelsea, on their way to the title it’s hell to watch them right now. But Mourinho’s men have taken us to heaven enough times this season to keep the critics off their backs.","Jose Mourinho under fire after Chelsea only have 30 per cent possession in Saturday's 1-0 win over Manchester United at Stamford Bridge .

273,d05f3a2c139515ffd315dadfa420b8be3fc6f6b2,"Two passenger jets allegedly came within 25 seconds of a mid-air collision over the Arabian Sea. One of the carriers involved, Dubai-based Emirates, referred to the apparent near-miss as an 'air traffic control incident' in a statement on Wednesday. Neither the Dubai carrier nor Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways would say how close the two planes came to each other. However a Resolution Advisory (RA) was given to both planes, which means the distance between the two aircraft could have resulted in a collision within 25 seconds. Etihad have maintained that the safety of its passengers was never compromised after it came 'within 25 seconds of collision' with an Emirates plane . The incident occurred on Monday as passenger planes from Emirates and Etihad Airways were traveling in opposite directions between the Gulf and the island nation of Seychelles. Both carriers have recently rerouted flights to the archipelago nation to avoid Yemeni airspace due to fighting there. Emirates says its flight EK709 was returning from the Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles when the incident occurred  in airspace controlled from Mumbai, India. Etihad Airways separately says it is investigating 'a reported incident' involving one of its planes traveling in the opposite direction. Both carriers insist safety was not compromised. This graphic shows the time in seconds of being at risk of traffic collision for each of the emergency warnings . The incident involving the Etihad Airways and Etihad occurred over the Arabian Sea in Mumbai airspace . Indian news broadcaster NDTV report that there was 'an emergency warning by the planes' on board collision avoidance systems,' and that both pilots reported the incident to Mumbai air traffic controllers. A Traffic Advisory (TA) is sounded to an aircraft when they are within 40 seconds of traffic in a particular airspace. Following this an RA is then given out if an aircraft is at risk of collision within 25 seconds, and the pilot has six seconds to respond. The Seychelles News Agency confirmed both planes received a ‘Resolution Advisory’ or RA, from the on-board Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The incident occurred over the Arabian sea when the two planes were passing each other . An Etihad Airways spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'Etihad Airways has strongly rejected claims that the safety of flight EY622, Abu Dhabi to the Seychelles, was compromised. 'The traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), which is fitted on all aircraft, ensured that safe vertical separation of both aircraft was maintained at all times. 'Etihad Airways has provided its safety reports to the GCAA and is assisting with its investigation as well as conducting its own investigation into the incident. 'Safety is Etihad Airways' number one priority.' A statement released by Emirates to the Times of India read: 'Emirates can confirm that flight EK 706 on March 29 from Seychelles to Dubai was involved in an air traffic control incident in Mumbai airspace. At no point was the aircraft, passengers or crew at risk. 'All Emirates aircraft are equipped with onboard instrumentation so that crew are alerted in a timely manner of all surrounding traffic. The crew informed the authorities of the incident and later filed an Air Safety Report, which will be forwarded to Mumbai Air Traffic Control. Safety is of paramount importance to Emirates, and we will be cooperating fully with the Mumbai Air Traffic Control in the subsequent investigation.' Both Etihad Airways and Emirates operate multiple flights every week to the Seychelles . Emirates and Etihad have both grown rapidly in recent years, enticing long-haul transit passengers through their Gulf hubs aboard relatively young aircraft. Emirates is owned by the government of Mideast commercial hub Dubai, while Etihad is controlled by the oil-rich Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi. Both carriers are regulated by the Emirates' General Civil Aviation Authority, which had no immediate comment. They each operate multiple flights weekly to Seychelles, a tropical tourism destination that has built close ties to the Emirates.","Incident occurred over the Arabian Sea in Mumbai Airspace .

But one Los Angeles resident can offer fans an even more intense taste of the singer's life, by letting them sleep in his house. Cobain lived in this two bedroom apartment on Spaulding Avenue in L.A.'s Fairfax district during the height of Nirvana-mania. Scroll down for video . The two-bedroom apartment is inside a 1920's building on Spaulding Avenue L.A.'s Fairfax district. A picture taken of Kurt Cobain in the early 90s, sitting on the end of the double bed he shared with Courtney Love. And with a parrot resting on his head, of course. The graffiti, however, has long since disappeared . Now its current owner, Brandon Kleinman, 31, has listed it on Airbnb. He wrote on the page advertising it: 'The place is the perfect combination of comfort, style, location and...rock n' roll history. 'Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love lived in the home during the height of Nirvana's musical influence 91-92 to be specific. 'At the time, Kurt was focused on song writing and his artwork, much of which was created in the apartment. 'He (Cobain) was particularly into painting during this time and even decorated the walls in the living room and bedroom.' 'His favourite spot in the house: the bathtub. In it, he wrote the song 'Heart-Shaped Box.' The couple lived in the apartment in 1991 and 1992, just before Frances Bean Cobain was born . It is described as 'beautiful, decorated and clean' - a far cry from the squalor revealed in photographs taken when Cobain moved out in 1992 . According to Charles R. Cross's 2001 Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven, the singer and his wife rented the unit for $1,100 (£727) a month. During the time they lived there, Love was pregnant with Frances Bean Cobain, while Cobain was focusing on song writing and his artwork, much of which was created in the apartment. Current guests will have to pay a little more to enjoy the central LA location, with Mr Kleinman offering the apartment for $4,5654 (£3,016) a month, or $1,142 (£754) a week (which works out at about $163/£108 per night). Current guests will have to pay a little more to enjoy the central LA location, with Mr Kleinman offering the apartment for £3016 a month, or £108 a night . Up to three guests can stay in one bedroom of the 1,500-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath flat. One of four homes inside a 1920's building, it offers a large living room with seating, a dining area and a small but fully stocked kitchen. It is described as  'beautiful, decorated and clean' - a far cry from the squalor revealed in photographs taken when Cobain moved out in 1992, which showed graffiti on the walls and rubbish scattering every available surface. The rooms where Cobain stayed have undergone a full renovation since he lived there . Cobain moved out when Love was eight months pregnant after a leak in the bathtub damaged the guitars, music and other possessions he stored there. Since then the place has been fully renovated and much of the idol's artwork has been covered up. Mr Kleinman told Vulture magazine: 'There's latex painting over the fireplace' It's owner suspects art painted by Cobain is hidden under layers of paint on the apartment's walls . 'I know there's tons of art painted on the actual mantel of the fireplace. I want to see if there's a way to get under the layered paint, to see what he painted under there.' 'I tried to get to the original hardwood floor in the hallway, but I can't,' he said. 'It's damaged because the bathtub leaked while Kurt and Courtney lived here. That's why they moved out.'

276,51c3c466239e3c9f3c319a481d0f81f07c9ea561,"(CNN)Jackson Gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old. By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. ""Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,"" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. ""I was frustrated every time I wore it,"" Gordon explains. ""It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character."" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding ""to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit."" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He ""didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it"" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. ""It was a little surprising,"" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that ""everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection."" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it ""cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day."" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to ""squish and compress,"" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with ""polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,"" ¼"" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says ""it can take anything but a gunshot."" The cowl was more problematic, being ""nearly impossible"" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, ""working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape."" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a ""silicone jacket"" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, ""durable and functional"" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. ""People love the theatricality of it,"" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with ""fully adjustable"" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design ""in the next couple of weeks."" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received ""easily over 50 requests from people,"" and not just from the cosplay community.  ""They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit."" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits. For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero.","21-year-old student Jackson Gordon has designed and built a functional Batsuit .

A passer-by captured photographs of the two criminals, and police have now appealed for the public to help them identify the offenders. Raid: One of two robbers who used a sledgehammer and an axe to try and break in to a jewellery shop . The attempted break-in took place in Pemberton, a suburb of Wigan in Greater Manchester, on Saturday afternoon. One of the raiders used a sledgehammer to smash through an internal wooden door and the other used a axe to smash security glass at Uncle Jewellers and Pawn Brokers. When a worker barricaded the door and pushed one of them back through the broken window they fled the scene, threatening a member of the public with the axe as they did so. Greater Manchester Police are now investigating whether the incident is linked to a similar break-in at another Wigan jeweller last week, which also involved a motorbike and a sledgehammer. Getaway: The two criminals used motorbikes to escape from the scene in Wigan, Greater Manchester . Detective Sergeant Pete Carletti said: 'This attempted robbery happened in broad daylight on a busy Saturday afternoon in Pemberton town centre. 'It caused a lot of commotion and I have no doubt there are lots of potential witnesses who saw what happened and could have vital information for us. 'We have obtained a large number of names of members of the public present in the area at the relevant time but I would ask for those people who have not yet spoken to police to contact us. 'The shop worker showed incredible bravery in the face of adversity to hold these two thieves back and I would like to commend them for their actions. Vehicle: One of the motorcycles used by the raiders, who were caught on camera by a bystander . 'I would also like to thank the member of the public who was brave enough to take photos of the offenders, although we would obviously never advise people to put themselves in danger to do so in any similar situation. 'We now need to find those responsible so I would again urge anyone who witnessed this appalling attempted robbery to come forward.'

Whitney Fetters, from Putnam City, Oklahoma, turned herself into cops in February after other students told teachers about the pictures but she was released after posting $10,000 bail. On Wednesday, Oklahoma County prosecutors charged her with one count of soliciting sex with a minor and one count of possession of marijuana. The Spanish teacher, who has since lost her job at Hefner Middle School, allegedly planned to invite the boy to spend the night with her as she was house-sitting 'so they could get high and have sex'. Scroll down for video . Charged: Whitney Fetters has been charged with soliciting sex with a minor and  possession of marijuana . Accused: She allegedly exchanged naked photos and sexual videos with the boy, and sent him sexually suggestive text messages. She also invited him over to get high and have sex . She had met the victim at the middle school when he was 12 and the two began sending each other harmless text messages, but last year, the messages became sexual. Court documents cited by News9 earlier this year indicated the victim sent the first sexually explicit message, telling Fetters he thought she was 'hot' with a partially nude photo of the boy. They allegedly went on to exchange 20 naked and partially nude images, as well as videos of themselves performing sex acts and explicit Snapchat messages. One text allegedly sent by Fetters to the boy read, 'Touching myself is fun', WSET reported. Another featured a photo of the woman wearing only her underwear with a text: 'That's all you get.' The teacher allegedly planned to invite the boy over to stay the night so they could have sex on February 13, but authorities learned of the relationship before that was able to happen. The plan emerged after other students told school staff that the boy had inappropriate photos of a woman,The Oklahoman reported. Caught: Fetters first started messaging the boy when he was 12 and the texts turned sexual last year . Fired: The 28-year-old Spanish teacher was fired after students told staff that the boy had photos of her . Officials learned of the allegations against the middle school teacher on January 30. When two school principals approached him during a school sporting event, he allegedly deleted the explicit photos and videos, but police were able to recover them. During a search of Fetters' family home, police seized her cell phone, computers, marijuana, and lingerie matching the photos found on the student's iPad. She was removed from her job and no longer works for the school district. Fetters graduated from the University of Central Oklahoma with a BA in Spanish. According to public records, she is not married.","Whitney Fetters turned herself into cops in February after it emerged she 'had exchanged X-rated photos and videos with the student'

Forensic officers attended the property on Merrygoen Rd in Neilrex on Wednesday where they executed a crime scene warrant. The death of a 20-month-old toddler is being treated as suspicious after he was admitted struggling to breathe . Police strongly believe that there are members of the Neilrex community, which is 60 kilometres south of Coonabarabran, that can help them with their investigation. According to the ABC, police have said that inquiries to date suggest the death was suspicious. Detective Inspector Cameron Whiteside said it was not the time to speculate or develop theories. 'This is a very serious matter...this is the death of a young child, a toddler,' he said. 'However I can tell you because of the nature of the information we received, the examination of the crime scene and the medical examination that's taken place in relation to the child, the investigation is being regarded as suspicious,' he told the Seven Network. The infant was rushed to Coolah District Hospital by emergency services but sadly died shortly after . Police are treating the incident as suspicious and executed a crime scene warrant on Wednesday . Detective Whiteside has also said that the child's parents have been spoken to and they are in ongoing contact with them in relation to the investigation.

280,5e0979d37ac3fecaa87fa7ecbafb2ec91b74a6b8,"You might think that you’re saving yourself some smart dollars by opting for the cheaper alternatives of everyday household items sold at two dollar stores but an environmental specialist has warned that you could actually be making your family sick. From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children’s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases. A recent study of four major discount retailers  in the United States by the Ecology Centre found that 133 out of 164 products tested, including children's jewellery, floor mats, kitchen utensils and silly straws, contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern'. From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children’s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases (stock picture) Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies, Nicole Bijlsma, told Daily Mail Australia that an investigation into products sold at Australian two dollar stores could produce similar results. Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies Nicole Bijlsma said the chemicals in these products are easily absorbed through ingestion and skin . 'Based on the amount of products that have been recalled over the years and studies which have found the levels of industrial chemicals are rising in younger generations, there's definitely a history to indicate that they [products at discount stores] could contain chemicals that cause adverse health affect,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'It depends on the type of chemical, but a lot of these things are absorbed through ingestion and dermal exposure. Kids have a very high hand to mouth ratio and are putting things in their mouth all the time.' A set of children's necklaces examined by the study were found to have high levels of bromine, chlorine and lead. Bromine is known to permanently affect developing brains and present reproduction problems in those exposed to it, while studies have found that chlorine causes cancer as well as thyroid and kidney disease. Meanwhile, scientists have found that even the smallest amount of lead can affect a child's ability to learn. Dozens of other products were also listed as having harmful chemicals, including silly straws which were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates which have been linked to birth defects, reduced fertility, cancer, learning disabilities, diabetes, and other health issues, according to the report. She said that a recent study of four major discount retailers in the United States, which found 133 out of 164 products tested contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern', would find similar results in Australia . Additional harmful substances found in the products included polyvinyl chloride plastic (also known as PVC or vinyl) and packaging chemical bisphenol-A (also known as BPA). 1. Buy Australian made products: They are subject to rigorous regulations and Australian manufactures are not permitted to use harmful chemicals. 2. Go back to basics: Use glass and stainless steel to store food instead of plastics. 3. Less is best: If it’s not edible, it won’t be good for your skin either, as it absorbs whatever is put on it. 4. Try the natural approach against pests first: Instead of pest sprays, install fly screens and ensure no food is around before reaching for chemicals. 5. Leave your shoes outside: take them off before you go inside and trek dust and pesticides from outside into your home . Ms Bijlsma, a building biologist, who assess people's homes - including measuring chemicals in their water, air, building materials and household products - to see what's making them sick, said that while discount stores were the focus of negative attention, harmful chemicals can be found in any product which is manufactured outside of Australia. 'About 90 per cent or more of our products, including footwear, clothing and furnishings, aren't actually manufactured in Australia. They're manufactured in Asia and imported products are not regulated in the same way as they are here and that's where the problem lies,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'To use a safer alternative would cost more money and sometimes it's just easier for company's not to bother doing research - why would they? In Australia they don't have to prove that the chemicals they are using are not harmful. 'BPA is a good example because people got wind that it was affecting children's behaviour and had an increased risk of breast cancer - so the manufacturer changed it and replaced it with bisphenol-S which has shown to be worse. A non-slip bath tub mat was found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates (stock pictures) 'It's about generating profits for industry and so they get cheap products in, but they neglect safety standards. 'It's possible because regulators don't ask for a certificate of analysis to prove there are no banned industrial chemicals  in the product and just assume that what the manufacturer overseas says is accurate.' A spokesman for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) told Daily Mail Australia that while 'there is always a possibility that some products on the market might not meet accepted standards of safety' the 'chance is very small'. It assured that the ACCC had an active chemical inspection program and that the products supplied to discount variety stores are 'often included in analytical surveys and surveillance activities conducted by the ACCC' and other product safety regulators. However they also put great emphasis on Australian Consumer Laws which require suppliers to 'ensure their products are safe and suitable for their intended purpose', saying: 'most suppliers have systems in place to source safe products.' Stock image: Children's stick-on earnings sold at the stores were found to contain high levels of bromine and chlorine and medium levels of tin . Latex coated gloves were found to have high levels of chlorine and medium levels of antimony while silly straws were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates (stock pictures) Ms Bijlsma said not enough was being done by the ACCC, which she said only completes occasional spot checks, with thousands of shipping containers going unchecked. 'The system is based on just doing spot checks here and there, but it doesn't happen with every product,' she said. 'We have a mismatch of five or six organisations in Australia that are involved in chemical and manufacturing regulation and they are under-resourced, understaffed and it takes them years to regulate a chemical. 'The way chemicals are regulated here is primarily through self-regulation: it's based on a reactive approach system where if you have had a significant health complaint from a consumer, you are obliged to pass it on. 'Then they [regulators] list it as a ""priority chemical"", see what other countries do and talk to other organisations, and write a recommendation report - this takes years. Extensions chords were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates while plastic spoons were found to have low levels of chlorine and tin (stock pictures) 'That's not adequate to protect our families' safety. It's not good enough. The system needs to change and the burden of proof needs to be on the manufacturer to prove the product is safe before it's released on the market.' The ACCC stated that products found to be unsafe are removed from the market or recalled by suppliers and that any company that fails to comply with standards faces a fine of up to $1.1 million. But part of the problem lies in the average Australian's trust that anything being sold to them on a supermarket shelf is tested, according to Ms Bijlsma. 'Consumers assume someone is regulating chemicals and that's where the problem lies. In reality, even 80 - 90 per cent of all the chemicals in household products like cleaning products and personal care products, have never been tested for harmful chemicals,' she said.","Over 100 items including children's jewellery, floor mats, kitchen utensils and silly straws contained either harmful plastics, metals or chemicals .
Many of the chemicals can be absorbed through ingestion and skin exposure, with children at risk due to their very high hand to mouth ratio .

A 30-year-old mother-of-two allegedly high on bath salts stabbed her family dog with a kitchen knife because she thought it was possessed by demons, according to police in Maine. Aroostook County Sheriff's Office responded to a home in Perham on Sunday and found Ashley Doody acting aggressively and exhibiting unpredictable behavior. They discovered that Doody, who is a nurse, had attacked her mixed-breed dog, Trixie. The sheriff says the dog lost a lot of blood but was taken to a veterinarian and is expected to survive - while Doody is in jail on $1,000 bail. She has been charged with aggravated cruelty to animals and is due to appear before Aroostock County Superior Court on May 19. According to deputies, when they arrived at the home, Doody was threatening to harm herself with the knife. They discovered that she had stabbed Trixie believing the dog was 'demon possessed.' Police have said that they believe Doody had taken bath salts which can cause severe agitation, paranoia, hallucinations and suicidal behavior in users. State animal welfare agents have been notified of the attack and already Doody has been banned from any access to pets in the future. According to her Facebook page, Doody is engaged to be married to Mark Sawyer and has been since May 2008.

Stacey Eden, 23, stood up for the Muslim woman and her partner after witnessing the ranter 'bullying' the Sydney commuter on an Airport Line train around 1:40pm on Wednesday afternoon. Ms Eden switched on the video camera on her mobile phone to record the vile rant before rushing to Muslim couple's defence with a fiery spray notably absent any swearing. A police spokeswoman contacted Daily Mail Australia on Thursday to say they would 'definitely encourage' witnesses of the incident to come forward. In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming:  'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Scroll down for video . Not going to take it anymore: Stacey Eden (pictured) made a bold stand in defence of a Muslim couple who faced a racially-charged tirade on a Sydney train on Wednesday afternoon . Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf . Ms Eden, who recorded a snippet of the conversation, fired back at the woman in defence of the Muslim couple (above): 'Have some respect... What's that got to do with this poor lady?' Ms Eden was not having a bar of it. 'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady? What's that got to do with her?' 'She was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before I spoke up then as soon I started defending them she stopped' The Muslim couple told Stacey Eden (left, right) that they were 'very grateful' for her stand . 'Nothing,' the ranter replied. 'Exactly!' Ms Eden fired back. 'You're the one who started the argument!' the woman said. Ms Eden then instructed the woman to be silent. 'No, you're the one sitting there saying things under your breath, shut your mouth, simple. 'You shut your mouth,' the woman replied. 'No, you shut your mouth. You've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything, simple.' Ms Eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone, ending with the passenger telling her to 'breathe'. She told Daily Mail Australia the Muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at Sydney International Airport.

The Muslim couple were 'very grateful' for her stand, she said. Police and Sydney Trains have not yet received any reports of the incident. The Islamophobia Register Australia group issued a statement praising Ms Eden's actions shortly after Daily Mail Australia's report. 'We are heartened by Stacey's actions - she is a reflection of 'Team Humanity' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification,' it said. The group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video. 'The sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like Daesh [Islamic State] are extrapolated to all 1.5+ billion Muslims'. The group's founder, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia incidents of abuse against Muslim women were becoming increasingly common. ''I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness),' she said. A hijab-wearing woman told the ABC last month she was subject to a physical and verbal assault on a Sydney train, with a man allegedly shoulder-charging her and hitting her with his bag and leg.

283,36b4a34bf0dddf129480d3fe1759a959cbe11118,"Everton will look to extend Darron Gibson's contract this summer as he recovers from the latest injury setback of his career. Roberto Martinez confirmed on Thursday that the Republic of Ireland international will miss the final seven games of the season with metatarsal damage, but expects him to be ready for pre-season as he does not require surgery. Gibson has endured a wretched time over the last 18 months, not least when he ruptured cruciate ligaments, and his position at Goodison Park could be regarded as vulnerable, particularly as Everton will rekindle their long-standing interest in Tom Cleverley in the summer. Everton midfielder Darron Gibson will not play again this season after damaging his metatarsal . Everton manager Roberto Martinez expects Gibson to return to pre-season in the best possible shape . Cleverley, who has spent the season on loan at Aston Villa, will become a free agent in July when his Manchester United contract expires and, given they have worked together before at Wigan, he is a player Martinez will consider recruiting. But Martinez has moved to assure Gibson he has a place in his plans. The 27-year-old was signed by David Moyes in January 2012 and has 12 months remaining on his current deal but his manager is already looking at his situation. 'This injury has arrived at such a bad moment because he was back from another long-term injury but it's something we'll look at in the summer,' said Martinez. 'I've been very pleased with Darron. Coming back from that sort of injury you don't reach 100 per cent for a long time. Everton will look to extend Gibson's contract this summer as he is treated for his latest injury setback . Martinez has moved to assure Gibson he has a place in his plans despite holding an interest in Tom Cleverley . 'But when he's been on the pitch, he's performed really well. From the Leicester game, all his performances have been really influential. Though he's now injured, he's been able to show his worth and for me he is an important player that we want here for the future. 'We are going to see him. But I'm not too worried. It is a tricky injury because if you don't heal it properly, it could come back. We need to make sure he is 100 per cent. If he is fully fit for pre-season, that would be fantastic. We don't have another player like him in the squad. 'We are trying to support him. He can add that calm feeling, he has shown his worth and what he is capable of adding. But it is tough, I won't lie. It is devastating for him. We just have to look at the positive that he doesn't need surgery. At one point, it looked very likely.' Cleverley is a target of Martinez and with his Manchester United contract running out a move could happen . Cleverley played under Martinez at Wigan, on loan from United, and has been at Villa Park this season . Having won their last three matches against Newcastle, QPR and Southampton, Everton have put together their best sequence of results in the Barclays Premier League for more than 12 months to clamber away from a potential relegation scrap. There is no chance, however, of them qualifying for Europe next season but Martinez does not think their potential to make new signings in the summer has been effected. He feels the club's progress over the last four years means they are strong enough to withstand this disappointment. Everton have put together their best sequence of results in the Barclays Premier League in over a year . Martinez does not think their potential to make new signings has been effected by a lack of European football . 'Within football when you face an opposition losing or winning doesn't affect players,' said Martinez. 'It's how you lose and I think every player who's faced Everton this season will have come out with a real respect and a real appreciation of the way we play as a club. 'We don't rely on 10 months of results, we've got a bigger picture of what we're trying to achieve and what we've got in the squad, particularly in terms of the younger players who have been given incredible roles. So I think the perception of Everton has improved in the last 12 months. 'We know the positions that we need to strengthen in the summer. It's something we've worked really hard on since January in order to identify those targets but a lot of decisions will depend on how we perform in the last seven games. It's going to be a very important end of season for us.' Martinez says he has 'got a bigger picture' of Everton's progress and does not rely on 10 months of results .","Darron Gibson has been ruled out for the rest of the season with injury .

Nathan Sellers went on the show with his ex, Lia Palmquist, and accused her of sleeping with every member of the Wu-Tang Clan during one night as she partied with them at a hotel after a show. That would mean Palmquist had sex with the RZA, the GZA, Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa, U-God, Inspectah Deck, Raekwon, Cappadonna and Method Man.

ODB is no longer alive . Palmquist admitted to partying with the guys from the Wu, but denied that she did anything sexual with them . Palmquist told show host Judge Lynn Toler: 'This sounds ridiculous, but he accused me of sleeping with the entire Wu-Tang Clan.' Sellers quickly fired back: 'She did.' The accused woman went on to tell Judge Toler that she did hang with the Clan on their tour bus and stay at their hotel until 7am talking politics, but maintained she stayed faithful to Sellers. She said: 'Nothing inappropriate happened and let me just put on the record that Wu-Tang is nothing but gentleman. 'They treated me highly respectful. 'I would never cheat on him. 'I would never be a bust-down or a groupie in that type of situation.' Unfortunately her ex-boyfriend wasn't buying it and Sellers said: 'She gave Wu some tang.' It's unclear who Judge Lynn believed, but she did say Palmquist engaged in 'bust-down behavior'. Sellers wasn't buying anything that his ex-girlfriend had to say and told the judge: 'She gave Wu some tang' It's unclear who Judge Lynn believed in the matter, but she did say Palmquist engaged in 'bust-down behavior' In March, the Wu-Tang Clan opened the silver box that held their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin .

'I didn't want to be stupid and get knocked out,' Johnson said. 'I had 25 minutes. I just took my time, and with 1 second left, I figured I better finish him.' Demetrious Johnson retained his UFC flyweight title with a win over Kyoji Horiguchi in Montreal . Johnson celebrates after a successful defence of his title at th Bell Centre in Canada on Saturday . The American secured a submission victory over Horiguchi in the latest UFC pay-per-view event . Horiguchi was dangerous in the opening round, as his blend of unorthodox, karate-based movements and impressive speed gave the champ some pause in the early going. But the Japanese contender was unable to truly capitalize on the opportunities, and it would cost him. Johnson (22-2-1) simply took over in the second round, showing the wide range of skills that have earned him recognition as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters. Constant pressure from the champ left Horiguchi (15-2) struggling to find any opportunity to attack. Instead, the challenger was constantly forced to try and prevent Johnson from taking his back, as they battled routinely against the fence and in the clinch. The American Johnson lands a right hand on his Japanese opponent during their bout in Montreal . Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson (right) beat Fabio Maldonado of Brazil to win his first bout since 2011 . It was one-way traffic until the final round, and the 23-year-old challenger was simply overwhelmed by the more experienced champ. Horiguchi tried to attack until the end, briefly threatening with a fifth-round triangle choke, but he was simply overwhelmed. While he was clearly ahead on the scorecards in the final seconds, Johnson turned up the volume, transitioned to an armbar and scored the submission win. Johnson successfully defended the title for the sixth time. In the co-main event, Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson (36-11) earned his first UFC win since 2011, scoring a unanimous decision over Brazilian slugger Fabio Maldonado (22-8).","Demetrious Johnson retains his UFC flyweight title .

286,65ad759320849550bb8e0a6a6615c5d834f65002,"Muhammad Naviede, 60, (pictured outside the Old Bailey in 1995) was killed instantly in a plane crash . A banking fraudster with links to Cherie Blair was killed instantly in a plane crash minutes after he sent a text saying his aircraft was going down, an investigation has revealed. Muhammad Naviede, who was jailed in 1995 for nine years for a £45million fraud, died after his Piper Tomahawk aircraft plummeted into a field near Padbury in Buckinghamshire. The 60-year-old, whose daughter is a former X-Factor contestant, sent a text to a relative shortly before the crash on August 20 last year saying: 'I'm in a plane out of control and it's going down.' An investigation by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the message was 'unusual' as the leased plane did not enter a spin until after it was sent. The experienced pilot had also tried to call the same relative before writing 148 characters within 25 seconds in a text - something the AAIB said would require 'considerable dexterity'. The report said: 'The pilot had accumulated considerable experience in a variety of aircraft in the years that he had been flying. He was familiar with the Piper Tomahawk aircraft and was in recent flying practice. 'It was suggested in his final text message that he had lost control of the aircraft, to such an extent that he did not expect to survive. 'However, after this message was sent, the aircraft continued in flight for more than two minutes, before entering a spin from which it did not recover.' Investigators found no fault with the aircraft and said weather conditions were unlikely to have caused the crash. Mr Naviede, of Regent's Park, London, had previously undertaken aerobatic training, meaning he 'would have recognised, and been able to recover from, a spin', according to the AAIB. The investigation also revealed the father-of-two had not booked a final destination for the fatal flight. Mr Naviede, whose personal wealth was once estimated to be £117million, was the former head of trade finance company Arrows, which collapsed owing more than £100 million to overseas banks and other creditors in 1991. He was the father of model and 2007 X-Factor contestant Raquelle Gracie, who was in girl band Hope, and had a record with Pharrell Williams. The girls initially auditioned for the fourth series as solo artists but judge Louis Walsh told them to re-audition as a band and they made it to the live shows where they came fifth. His Piper Tomahawk aircraft plummeted into a field near Padbury in Buckinghamshire in August last year . The pilot had written a 148 character text within 25 seconds - something the Air Accident Investigation Branch said would require 'considerable dexterity especially in an aircraft that may have been out of control' Ms Gracie, who is married with an 18-month-old daughter, is now a yoga teacher and continues to sing after previously hosting an online news and gossip series on website Dipdive, created by will.i.am. His brother was the former Government race advisor Nighat Awan, who entertained Mrs Blair at her multi-million pound home in Cheshire in 2004. In 1995, a jury at the Old Bailey convicted him of seven charges of fraudulent trading, obtaining property and services by deception and making false statements to obtain bank facilities. On the day of the crash, Mr Naviede had flown the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk from Elstree, Hertfordshire, to Turweston Aerodrome before heading on to White Waltham airfield near Maidenhead, Berkshire. He was then due to return to Elstree, but at 4.55pm Mr Naviede telephoned the aerodrome to say he would not be returning that day and did not book an alternative destination. The plane took off from White Waltham shortly after 5pm, heading north, and when he was just south of Buckingham, he began to fly in a circle for almost an hour at between 2,500ft and 4,700ft. His daughter Raquelle Gracie (far right) came fifth in the 2007 series of the X Factor with girl band Hope . It was at this time he made a number of calls on his mobile telephone and at 6.31pm he unsuccessfully tried to call the relative who he then sent the final text to. Investigators suggested that two minutes later he still had 'at least control of lateral flight'. The aircraft then turned to the left as the pilot sent out a 'Mayday' distress call, saying: 'Lost control of the aircraft and it's gone into a spin.' Mr Naviede then confirmed his location to the controller before saying: 'I can't control it.' Mr Naviede's brother was former Government race advisor, Nighat Awan, who entertained Mrs Blair at her multi-million pound home in Cheshire in 2004 . The AAIB report said: 'It was apparent, from the witness accounts and the on-site evidence, that the aircraft had entered a spin from which it did not recover. 'The time elapsed during the pilot's final radio transmissions, together with the rate of descent deduced from the NASA videos, suggested that the spin was likely to have started from a minimum height of 2,500ft, and probably higher.' The report also highlighted strange aspects of Mr Naviede's behaviour on the day, although people who spoke to him said he appeared 'chatty, friendly and relaxed'. Investigators wrote: 'There were a number of events which took place in the course of the afternoon which represented unusual actions on the part of the pilot. 'It appears the pilot made a change of intended destination prior to leaving White Waltham. 'Having booked out for Elstree he subsequently called them to advise he would not be returning there. He did not book out to any other destination. 'After departing White Waltham and flying north for about half an hour, he flew in a large circular pattern for almost an hour. 'Although somewhat unusual, this may be explained by the need to re-charge the aircraft battery.' Mr Naviede, who had more than 3,000 hours of flying experience, died instantly in the crash and a post-mortem examination carried out on his body revealed he died as a result of multiple injuries. A date has not been set for an inquest but it is likely to take place in May with a jury.","Muhammad Naviede died after his Piper Tomahawk aircraft crashed in field .

287,879e8cfb61b654aaff814b537fbe448fdc19c1e7,"(CNN)Two Transportation Security Administration screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at Denver International Airport, Denver police said. Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker . All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks . The TSA called the incident deplorable. ""These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,"" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. ""All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable."" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim. The TSA said it has been trying to identify the passenger in the February incident but to no avail. The TSA said no passengers have come forward with similar cases so far at the Denver airport. Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing from luggage . CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.","Police: A male TSA officer signaled to a female officer when he found a man attractive .

In fact, they were the drunkards banned from every boozer in Birmingham for a string of crimes including drink-driving a steam engine, riding a horse while drunk and being intoxicated to the point of 'complete incompetence'. They were all placed on the 1904 blacklist after four convictions under the Inebriates Act of 1898. The list was then sent to landlords who were not allowed to sell them alcohol. Scroll down for video . Boozy: Kitted out in a bowler hat and waistcoat, he may appear to be a right-thinking member of Edwardian England, but Matthew Moran was banned from every pub in Birmingham at the turn of the century . Black listed: Alice Tatlow was also banned from every Birmingham boozer for being 'drunk and disorderly'; publicans were told they could recognise her by a tattoo of the Prince of Wales's feathers . Barred: 46-year-old Mary Bayliss was one of the many respectable-looking women barred from drinking in Birmingham after being found drunk and disorderly . On the blacklist, each drunkard’s entry includes photographs, their name, alias, residence, employment, physical description, distinguishing marks, nature of conviction and the sentence received for booze-related crimes. Offenders who were caught drunk and disorderly were ordered to work up to 21 days of 'hard labour' in comparison to today's fixed penalty or fine. They form part of the UK Midlands Collection, which covers a 400 year period and contains more than 21 million records detailing the good, the bad and the famous who have shaped the history of the city. Unearthed by Ancestry, the world's largest online family history resource, the records are available for all to see. Ladette: Elizabeth Thompson was a 29-year-old prostitute when she was arrested for drunkenness and sentenced to two weeks' hard labour . Rowdy: Charwoman Susannah Booton was arrested for drunken behaviour in February 1906 . Criminal: Each notice bore a mugshot of the criminal, as well as a description of their nose and face; Annie Hodgkins was said to have a 'fresh complexion' despite being sentenced to three weeks' hard labour . Poster: Unemployed Kate Kibble, another woman convicted of being drunk and disorderly, was described as having a 'broad' build, as well as losing her right eye and having 'both little fingers crooked' Some of the bizarre offences committed by past Birmingham residents include theft of a dead duck and riding a horse while drunk. Nearly 10,000 Edwardian felons are listed in the UK Midlands criminal registers providing fascinating insight into the murky underworld of Birmingham's metropolis more than a century ago. Among those on the blacklist are Henry Bonus, 40, who was sentenced to a year's hard labour and three months' police supervision after stealing eight pounds of ham. Elsewhere, 18-year-old William Handley was sentenced to eight months' hard labour and one-year's police supervision for stealing a 'dead duck' and a teapot. Careers: Sarah Henson combined her job as a dressmaker with an extra source of income as a prostitute, before being banned from pubs for being drunk and disorderly . Haggard: Just 38, Eliza Fallon looked a lot older than her years when she was arrested for drunkenness . Distinctive: Sarah Evans, left, and Ellen Heaton, right, could be recognised by their scars, according to the Birmingham archives . Records reveal how offenders came from a variety of backgrounds, such as metal cutters, grease merchants, labourers and hawkers. Many had aliases - suggesting criminal careers - while others had scars or physical handicaps, ranging from Kate Kibble's one eye to cut marks on faces, broken noses and missing fingers. Some, however, lived perfectly respectable lives - until they walked through the door of their local watering hole. It shows how those living in Edwardian England were just as likely to get half-cut and troublesome on a night out as boozy Brits in today's binge drinking culture.","Archives reveal list of drunkards banned from every pub in Birmingham .

289,b335401d4c5db42440f1b39ce6bc89a5a9682a93,"Secretary of State John Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and get away with it, says the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain. 'I think John Kerry tried to come back and sell a bill of goods, hoping maybe that the Iranians wouldn’t say much about it,' the Republican lawmaker told radio host Hugh Hewitt during his Thursday program. McCain, responding to the supreme leader of Iran's proclamation yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because Kerry 'must have known' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to interpret it in another way.' Launching a rare attack from his official White House Twitter account, President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest in turn said it was 'naïve and reckless' for McCain 'to believe every word of the Supreme Leader's political speech.' 'He shouldn't,' Earnest added. And the president's deputy national security adviser told reporters traveling with the administration abroad that it's 'very clear and understood that sanctions relief will be phased.' Secretary of State John Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and get away with it, says the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain . Kerry, is flanked here by President Barack Obama and National Security Adviser Susan Rice at the bilateral meeting between President Obama and Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela today in Panama City, Panama. The Obama administration is in Panama to attend the VII Summit of the Americas . 'The fact of the matter is, we have framework,' Rhodes said, according to the Associate Press. 'The president has said if the details don't bear out, we won't have a deal.' Obama, Kerry, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and other members of the president's kitchen cabinet are in Panama for the Summit of the Americas. Backed into a corner by reporters, the White House on Monday indicated that negotiators left Switzerland last week without coming to an agreement about the pace at which sanctions would be removed. The administration had stated in a fact sheet that nuclear-related sanctions would be 'suspended' if Iran complied with the terms of the deal. The president said in a live statement they would be 'phased' out over time. The framework, however, he said would remain in place so sanctions could be snapped back into place if need be. Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, immediately cast a cloud over the United State's assertions, pointing out that the statement released by the United States' negotiating partners made no reference to either the gradual lifting of sanctions. Zarif indicated that his country was under the interpretation was that sanctions would be 'terminated.' Asked the next day about Zarif's claims, the lead spokeswoman for the State Department shrugged them off and said she wasn't too concerned with how Iranian leaders sold the deal in their own country. Barraged with questions at his Monday briefing about who was lying - the U.S. or Iran - White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest suggested that the timing of sanctions relief remained a topic of discussion - a major revelation given the dispute's potential for derailing a written agreement. Khamenei reaffirmed on Thursday his country's vow not to sign an agreement unless negotiators kowtow to Iran's demands and promise the 'instant annulment of all sanction,' according to a translation. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani similarly said, 'We will not sign any agreement, unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal.' Khamenei further stated Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring.' 'Foreign monitoring on #Iran's security isn’t allowed,' he said on Twitter. Speaking to reporters in Panama today, Rhodes also dismissed Iranian officials' rhetoric about the agreement as spin. 'They have their own hardliners who are skeptical of this deal,' he said. 'The test of whether or not that framework can be memorialized is not a comment on any given day by an Iranian leader, the test will be if by the end of June we have a document.' Responding to the supreme leader of Iran's announcement yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' McCain, above, said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because Kerry 'must have known' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to interpret it in another way' McCain ripped into former colleague Kerry on Hewitt's radio show for mischaracterizing preliminary talks with Iran. 'It’s probably in black and white that the Ayatollah is probably right,' McCain said. 'John Kerry is delusional.' Continuing, the Arizona senator said, 'I think you’re going to find out that they had never agreed to the things that John Kerry claimed that they had.' 'So in a way, I can’t blame the Ayatollah, because I don’t think they ever agreed to it.' Republican Senator Mark Kirk on Thursday said, 'It’s increasingly clear that Iran, in fact, failed to reach agreement with the United States and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement. 'At best, Iran agreed to disagree with the United States on key nuclear weapons-related issues and to continue talks,' the Illinois lawmaker said. McCain told Hewitt Kerry's behavior 'reveals that a number of things' about his 'negotiating capabilities and also his candor with the American people.' He also said he believes Senate Republicans are 'extremely close' to winning enough Democrats' support to push through a veto-proof bill giving Congress the power to review the formal deal with Iran that is scheduled to materialize by June 30. Khamenei further stated that Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring' Even with out that legislation, McCain claimed that the Senate has the Constitutional authority to reject an accord because it is technically treaty. Obama should 'read the Constitution of the United States,' McCain said. This is clearly a treaty.' And even if the president 'disregards the Constitution' McCain said - 'which he certainly did with executive orders concerning immigration' - Congress should have a say in an issue of this scale. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the Armed Services Committee who is exploring a presidential run, said in a statement Friday afternoon that 'the Ayatollah and President Obama appear to be talking about two separate agreements. 'Unfortunately, I can’t say I’m surprised,' he added. 'President Obama wants a deal way too badly, and his Administration has been trying to sell a deal which may not actually exist.' Graham said the Obama administration should tell Iran 'in no uncertain terms – that should we come to an actual agreement between both parties, sanctions relief will not be immediate.' 'Any realistic agreement must preclude sanctions relief from being granted until Iran proves it has ended its military nuclear program.' Drawing on Khamenei's comment about supervision, Graham said he would 'never' lend his support to a deal that doesn't allow for inspections 'anytime and anywhere.' With 'Iran’s history of cheating,' he said, 'it would be incredibly dangerous not to require Iran to abide by an ‘anytime-anywhere’ inspections regime.'","Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions when they didn't and get away with it, he said .

Speaking about the potent powder, food blogger and nutritionist Deliciously Ella said: 'Acai is unbelievably rich in antioxidants, with one of the highest levels ever tested (eight times that of blueberries and 10 to 30 times that of red wine,) as well as vitamin E and omega-3s, all of which work to stop free radical damage and keep your body. 'It’s also amazing for keeping your skin glowing and slowing down the signs of ageing.' The large seed from each berry is removed and the remaining Açaí pulp (along with its nutrients) is frozen within 24 hours of being harvested, due to the fresh berry’s short lifespan.

The identical twins’ establishment opened in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world. The duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe, for charging £3.20 for a bowl of cereal. The single-item cafe movement is not just confined to London.

The acai berry is a rich purple palm fruit indigenous to the Amazon rainforest. For hundreds of years, these small dark berries have been integral to the diet of native Amazon people. The berries are packed with amino acids, as well as vitamins A, B, C and E and minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper and zinc. The fruit perishes quickly after being picked, so to help preserve its goodness it is often made into acai berry juice, supplements or powder, which is often whizzed into a smoothie. According to some sites selling acai products, the berry's fibre and essential fatty acid content contribute to its ability to burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly, cut down on cravings, and boost metabolism.","Oshun Cafe serves four variations of Brazilian superfood, costing £6 each .

It will certainly make it an interesting test for Pochettino's side as they look to recover from some disappointing recent results of their own. 'You never know because sometimes the effect on the players and team maybe is positive,' the Spurs boss said. 'Maybe sometimes the players are scared and run more than all season. 'Or maybe it is a very negative atmosphere and they feel under pressure and don't show their face. 'You never know in football how it can affect all the decisions around the team. For that it is difficult to guess what will happen on Sunday.' On paper, this looks a good opportunity for Spurs to make amends for the goalless draw at Burnley and home defeat to Aston Villa. Christian Benteke scored the winner for Aston Villa to leave Spurs' season in danger of fizzling out . The fact Pochettino's predecessor Tim Sherwood oversaw the latter's victory made it all the more frustrating, yet the Spurs boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to St James' Park. 'I think that football is football and I am a person who has spent all my life in football as player, manager and head coach,' he said. 'I accept in football there are good and bad moments, but one thing important is to keep your balance and a good mood. 'We always want to win and we are ambitious, but always we need to have a very good mood. 'We need to have patience, we need to work hard, we have to have our minds on the players and we need to have very good energy to repeat some of the performances this season.' Pochettino will come up against his countryman Jonas Guiterrez following his recovery from cancer . This weekend's match against Newcastle will also see Pochettino come up against a countryman who has made many a headline of late. Former Argentina international Jonas Gutierrez's recovery following a battle with cancer and his return to top-flight football has inspired many. 'I am very happy for him,' Pochettino said. 'When he went in the game against Liverpool, he got a good ovation and it was good to see him playing football. 'This is real life. Sometimes we worry about a lot of things and results, but this is real life when you have the problems that he has. 'For me, I am very happy to see him come back to football.'","Tottenham travel to Newcastle for their Premier League clash on Sunday .

Once the animals are done in the ring, they'll be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida. Some of the Asian Elephants will live out their post-performance lives in the center, while other will be used for breeding. Scroll down for video . All elephants will be phased out of the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus performance by 2018 . Once they retire from performing, elephants will be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida . Ringling spokeswoman Melinda Hartline told FOX Tampa Bay that the center is 'all about preserving the Asian Elephant'. Elephants born in the center can be sold to zoos or other breeding programs. This will hopefully increase genetic diversity in the species and increase its population. The population of animal has decreased to between 25,000 and 32,000 from it's 100,000 population over the last century. Poaching and habitat destruction are among the reasons for the decline. Twenty people work at the center to feed, care for and manage the animals, and over the next three years Ringling will determine if more staff or additional facilities are needed. Despite having what seems to be ideal living conditions, Ringling ties some elephants by the leg overnight, something animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) are disappointed by. Some elephants will live out the rest of their lives in the conservation center, while others will be use for breeding . A spokesman for the center said that the organization's goal is to conserve the Asian Elephant, an animal who has seen massive population decline over the last century . Much of the population decline - which has gone down from 100,000 to between 25,000 and 32,000 - has been caused by poaching and habitat destruction . 'Zoos don't chain elephants and the American Veterinary Medical Association advises against it' Delciana Windners, PETA general counsel, told FOX. The animal-rights organizations also urge the company to take the animals off the road sooner. Just days before announcing that the elephants would be taken out of the ring, PETA prevailed in an open-records request and obtained documents proving that, at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis. TB is highly transmissible from elephants to humans, even without direct contact. A statement from PETA frames Ringling’s announcement as a preemptive move to keep the public in the dark about the health risk posed by moving sick elephants to cities throughout the country. 'These elephants suffer greatly, but now their retirement is vital to everyone’s safety,' the statement read. Animal rights groups, including PETA, have said that Ringling Brothers should take elephants out of their shows before 2018 .

296,3be4f31cd94e867338e4a27496818d31e9486d49,"On trial: Former Ukip MEP Ashley Mote (pictured arriving at London's Southwark Crown Court today) is accused of a string of fraud-related offences . A former Ukip MEP fraudulently claimed almost £500,000 in European Parliament expenses - using some of it to fund his domestic court battles, a court heard today. Ashley Mote, 79, of Binsted, Hampshire, is accused of a string of fraud-related offences including acquiring criminal property and obtaining a money transfer by deception. Some of the money he allegedly made from the fraud went towards funding various legal costs he had built up as a result of being prosecuted in the UK for benefit fraud offences, a jury at London's Southwark Crown Court was told. He denies 11 offences alleged to have taken place between November 2004 and July 2010. Jonathan Davies, prosecuting, said that as an MEP, Mote could claim expenses, including a Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, or Secretarial Allowance, to help fund his work. Mr Davies said: ‘What the prosecution say happened between 2004 and 2009, when Mr Mote ceased to be an MEP, is that he abused that allowance by submitting false claims for payment for work which he said to the European Parliament had been done by organisations working on his behalf.’ Jurors heard that two of the organisations had previously campaigned against UK membership of the European Union. They were the Better Off Out Fund (Boof), and Direct Action Resistance To Tyranny (Dartt). However, it is alleged that neither of these companies conducted any work for Mote, who made claims of £16,000 against Boof, and £54,000 to Dartt. ‘They were simply used as a front to perpetrate, carry out fraud and to receive monies from the European Parliament,’ said Mr Davies. European Parliament in Brussels: Prosecutors claim Mote was 'using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud' Mote is also said to have falsely claimed £5,000 a month for work he claimed had been carried out by Estonia based company Icos (Information Centrum Owned State). It is alleged that he even set up a Danish bank account under the similar name of ‘Information Centrim OS’ for funds from the European Parliament to be paid into, ‘dishonestly obtaining’ approximately €355,000. Giving details of Mote carrying out fraud to fund his rising legal bills, Mr Davies said: ‘He asked for payments to be made to the firm of solicitors on the basis that they were providing him with advice in relation to his duties as an MEP. ‘In fact the money was being used to fund a number of criminal and civil proceedings related to Mr Mote's prosecution for benefit fraud offences, and indeed some unrelated civil proceedings. ‘Basically we say he was using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud.’ Mr Davies continued: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud committed over several years during which Mr Mote made a number of false representations and produced a number of false documents in order to deceive the European Parliament into believing that significant amounts of work were being done on his behalf, relating to his work as an MEP. Pleading not guilty: Mote (pictured again today) allegedly fraudulently claimed almost £500,000 in expenses . ‘In total he dishonestly obtained approximately €355,000 and £184,000 of allowances to which he was not entitled. It's not quite half a million pounds, but it's not far short.’ Jurors heard that while MEPs were allowed to make certain legitimate claims for expenses from the European Parliament, they were not supposed to use this money to enrich themselves. Between 2004, when he was elected MEP and 2009, Mote claimed a total of £750,000 in Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, taking into account his legitimate claims and any alleged fraudulent activity. Mote was elected a Ukip MEP for South East England in 2004, but shortly before he actually took up his seat was thrown out of Nigel Farage's party because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud. However, he sat as an independent MEP until 2009, when he decided not to stand for election. The court heard that in April 2004 Mote's case for alleged income support, council tax and housing benefit fraud was sent to crown court to be dealt with, and he was elected as an MEP two months later. Elected as MEP: Mote (pictured in 2006) was thrown out of Ukip because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud . But he made an application to the court saying that the criminal proceedings against him were a breach of his rights to free movement, as his bail conditions meant he could not travel freely to Europe. The courts agreed with this and proceedings against Mote were stayed, prompting the prosecution to make an application to the Attorney General to review the matter. Jurors heard that in light of this, Mote wrote to the manager of European Parliament allowances asking for expenses to allow him to fight this. He wrote: ‘I have to fund myself in the legal affairs committee against an attempt by the British government to unseat me as an MEP. This is going to incur legal costs.’ However, Mr Davies told the court that Mote did not disclose that he was being prosecuted for fraud. He said: ‘What Mr Mote doesn't say is something along the lines of “I am being prosecuted for fraud arising out of events prior to being elected as an MEP”.’ Jurors heard that the Attorney General overturned the decision and Mote was prosecuted and convicted of benefit fraud in August 2007. Mote denies four counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three of false accounting, two of fraud, and one each of acquiring criminal property and concealing criminal property. The trial resumes at 10am tomorrow when the opening will continue.

297,2d896bc51bc066ffe6148f13a43bd779ccebdb4b,"A mayoral candidate has bungee jumped from a bridge where his ancestor plummeted 160ft to his death for a drunken bet worth just a sixpence. Dave Roberts, who is in the running to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, followed in his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister's footsteps by leaping off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees. However, instead of falling to his death like his relative did more than 100 years ago - Mr Roberts survived the jump which he carried out for a children's charity. Dave Roberts, who hopes to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, has bungee jumped off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees 100 years after his ancestor jumped to his death for a bet worth just a sixpence . Mr Roberts, a 50-year-old former TV and radio presenter, said 'Daniel, this one's for you' as he jumped off the bridge - in reference to his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister who died after leaping off the bridge in 1913 . The 50-year-old former TV and radio presenter, from Marton, Middlesbrough, said: 'I thought it was going to be sheer terror, but I actually really enjoyed it. 'I had a good moment just before the jump. The guy was saying, I am going to count to three, and then you are going to jump. 'I said, I need to speak to my relative. I said: ""Daniel, this one's for you. I am going to collect your winnings"". 'I screamed like a child as I was going down, but thoroughly enjoyed it.' Mr McAllister was challenged to jump off the bridge by a friend after drinking in a pub in Port Clarence in a bet worth a sixpence. He died on May 4, 1913 at the age of 30. Newspaper articles from 1913 about Mr McAllister's death (pictured) tell how he 'dived to his death' and drowned following an 'amazing act of bravado' The cause of death was listed as: 'Shock and suffocation from drowning through jumping from the Transporter Bridge in a spirit of bravado whilst under the influence of drink.' Father-of-two Mr Roberts, who grew up listening to stories about his ancestor, managed to track down Mr McAllister's death certificate, which listed him as a general labourer of Washington Street in Middlesbrough. Mr Roberts, who was handed a sixpence and a beer after his jump this week, said: 'A century after Daniel was killed, and in a bid to exorcise the ghost of my ancestor, I decided I would have a go at the jump as well. 'But I wanted to do it as a charity event, and make sure I was safely attached to a bungee rope! 'The Daniel McAllister story has been in the family for over a century. 'No one really believed it to be true as all attempts to link it to the 1913 bridge jump had failed due to searching the wrong line of the family tree. 'Then we found a 1899 marriage certificate of Daniel's sister Emily, which opened a new route and this finally provided the link we needed.' Mr Roberts, who lives with his wife Francesca, 45, and children Kari, 14, and Luke 12, is running for mayor having moved back to England from a job in Singapore 18 months ago where he was vice president of business development for Fox TV. He said: 'This was all fun and games but I am a serious mayoral candidate for the town who has a great sense of humour and I'll be making a lot of serious points in the run-up to the election as I am a Middlesbrough lad who cares deeply about his town. 'Normally town mayors get set for the high jump after their term in office, this one got out of the way before the hard work starts.' He asked Teesside residents to stump up £2.50 - roughly what a sixpence would be worth today - to support him and raise money for the MFC Foundation which helps children in need.

298,f7e0de384a8e52cafaa3161f71a979d269fe12fe,"(CNN)The Tulsa County reserve deputy who fatally shot a man instead of using his Taser turned himself in to authorities Tuesday at the Tulsa County Jail. Video shows Reserve Deputy Robert Bates announcing he is going to deploy his Taser after an undercover weapons sting on April 2 but then shooting Eric Courtney Harris in the back with a handgun. Bates was charged with second-degree manslaughter Monday. He surrendered Tuesday morning, accompanied by his attorney, Clark Brewster, and immediately posted bail of $25,000. As he exited the jailhouse, Bates paused in front of television cameras for a moment but did not speak. His attorney reiterated that he believes the charge against his client is unwarranted. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says a sting operation caught Harris illegally selling a gun. Harris ran when officers came in for the arrest. Authorities say Bates thought he pulled out his Taser but ""inadvertently"" fired his gun. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, told CNN that he is pleased District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler pressed charges. In his opinion, however, no type of force should have been used in the arrest of his brother. Watching the video of the shooting, Andre Harris said he can see that three or more officers were already on top of his brother. That manpower should have been enough to arrest him, he said. ""It was a situation where I didn't necessarily think that a Taser should even be used,"" Andre Harris said. Scott Wood, another Bates' attorney, has said the shooting was an ""excusable homicide."" Investigators' efforts to defend Bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online. Harris' relatives are demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality. They're also questioning why the 73-year-old Bates -- the CEO of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high-risk sting operation. Daniel Smolen, an attorney representing the Harris family, said Bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time. Bates, who was a police officer for a year in the 1960s, had been a reserve deputy since 2008, with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience, according to the sheriff's office. He was also a frequent contributor to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, including $2,500 to the re-election of Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The sheriff's office has said that Bates had law enforcement certification, but Smolen said he has not seen any field training records. ""We're holding up all right at this point,"" Andre Harris said. ""We're putting our faith in God that justice will be served, and we can get some closure in this situation."" How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? In a statement released Tuesday, Eric Harris' family members said they know there are many good deputies working in Tulsa County. ""However, the treatment of Eric of April 2 clearly shows that there is a deep-seated problem within the TCSO,"" the statement said. The family said that the sheriff has not apologized and that the department has not shown remorse or indication it will change its policies. CNN's Jason Morris and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","Reserve Deputy Robert Bates surrenders to authorities, posts bail of $25,000 .

299,8ad87b83c0033077d7bfe8a13d5507126330dde0,"Patterns appearing on both the very large and very small scale are rare in nature. But researchers have found such a pattern in two apparently unrelated places - cells in human skin, and the mysterious fairy circles in Namibia. While the distribution of desert fairy circles may look random, as if the landscape is marked with freckles, the pattern closely matches the distribution pattern of skin cells. Researchers have found a similar pattern in two apparently unrelated places - skin cells and the mysterious fairy circles in the Namibian desert. The illustration on the left shows the distribution of skin cells, and the one on the right plots fairy circles, which are also arranged in polygons . ‘It's a completely amazing, strange match,’ said Professor Robert Sinclair, head of the Mathematical Biology Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan. Desert fairy circles are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because no one knows how they form. Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth measuring anywhere between 10ft and 65ft in diameter (three metres to 20 metres) that are ringed by short grass dotting the scrub land like craters on the moon, or big freckles. Several teams of scientists are trying to explain the bizarre markings, and suggestions have included termites nibbling grass, zebras rolling in circles, competition for resources, hydrocarbons emanating from the depths of the earth to kill off patches of vegetation and even aliens. Desert fairy circles (pictured) are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because it is now known how they form. Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth ringed by short grass dotting the desert like craters on the moon, or big freckles . Now, Professor Sinclair and Haozhe Zhang believe they have identified a small, but vital, piece of the puzzle by comparing their distribution to skin cells. The duo compared the number of 'neighbours' adjacent to fairy circles and skin cells, according to the study published in Ecological Complexity. They used satellite images of fairy circles and a computer to draw lines halfway between each pair to give them invisible boundaries that look similar to cell walls. The majority of skin cells and fairy circles both had six 'neighbours', and similar percentages of other neighbours (shown in this graph) The computer then counted how many neighbours surrounded each fairy circle. Another group of researchers had calculated skin cell neighbours in a similar way several years ago, which was used as a comparison. The experts found that the results were almost identical, in that both the majority of skin cells and fairy circles had six neighbours. And the percentage of fairy circles with four, five, six, seven, eight and nine neighbours was essentially the same as the skin cells. ‘I didn't expect it to be so close,’ Professor Sinclair said. ‘We spent a lot of time checking because it really looked too close to believe.’ Mr Zhang, a PhD student at Iowa State University who was previously at OISTsaid that future mathematical models designed to explain how fairy rings are made should incorporate the results of this study. The researchers suspect the patterns might be similar because both skin cells and fairy circles are fighting for space. Professor Sinclair said: ‘It is still difficult to say why exactly they are similar, but the fact that they are similar is already very important. ‘This is suggesting there may be such types of patterns that cover really different size scales.’ Huge swathes of grassland in Namibia is covered with mysterious vegetation-free patches that have been baffling scientists for decades. While a number of studies have suggested the fairy circles are created by industrious termites, research last May claimed they are the result of resource competition for water among plants. German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles and found that they are ‘remarkably regular’ in their distribution, which made them question the termite theory. Experts from various institutions have previously claimed that termites nibble away at grassroots in certain grasslands of southwest Africa, causing the dieback of vegetation and creating a water trap. Last year, German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles (pictured in the Marienfluss Valley) and found that they are 'remarkably regular' in their distribution. There is a no vegetation growth within the circular area . The genesis of a fairy circle has not been observed. Their occurrence appears to be restricted to particularly arid zones at the border of grassland and desert regions, according to the study published in the journal Ecography, where there is intense resource-competition for water. Dr Getzin's team was joined by experts from Göttingen in Germany, Italy and Israel who studied aerial images of the circles in north west Namibia to pinpoint the location and distribution of the barren patches within the surrounding landscape. Using statistical methods, they found that the circles are distributed regularly across large areas. ‘The occurrence of such patterning in nature is rather unusual. There must be particularly strong regulating forces at work,’ Dr Getzin said. He believes it is the local resource-competition among plants and vegetation, in a similar way to how young trees space themselves out in forests to ensure they have access to enough nutrients and water. ‘A similar process of resource-competition may consequently also be the real cause for a self-organising formation of the mysterious fairy circle patterns,’ the study says. The scientists simulated underground competition for water and the spatial vegetation distribution patterns. They found that similar patterns emerged on the screen to those recorded in Namibia.","It is not known how fairy circles in the Namibian desert are made .

300,ad1fd9bc7aaa1652edc615d6bd42bed5066aff95,"Detectives probing the murders of a Playboy bunny and a 16-year-old schoolgirl 40 years ago have offered a £40,000 reward in a bid to bring their killer to justice. Eve Stratford, a 22-year-old glamour model who worked at London's Playboy club, was found with her throat slashed in her Leyton home on the evening of 18 March 1975. Six months later, Lynne Weedon, 16, was  attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow at 11pm on September 3, as she returned from a night out with friends. She was found abandoned and barely alive at an electricity sub-station the next morning and died a week later. Eve Stratford, 22, a Playboy bunny, was stabbed between eight and 12 times when she was murdered on the evening of 18 March 1975 . Both murders were linked in July 2006 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims, who did not know each other. It appears the motive was sexual - Lynne had been raped, and it is likely Eve had also been raped although detectives haven't been able to rule out consensual sex. The reward was posted last night as detectives appealed for information, which could lead to the identification, arrest and prosecution of those responsible, on BBC's Crimewatch show. Lynne's mother, Margaret Weedon, described the murder 40 years ago as a 'true life sentence' for the family. Lynne Weedon (right) was beaten over the head with a blunt object. Detectives believes Lynda Farrow (left), who was knifed to death in 1979, was also a victim of the same killer . She said: 'We have missed out on so much; she missed out on life, no relationship or marriage, no career or children or even just travelling the world, all taken from her. 'We are left 40 years on always wondering what it would have been like. 'We are well aware that whoever murdered Lynne also murdered Eve Stratford. That young lady also had her life snubbed out. Her family have died now. Another true life sentence. 'The hurt eases but the pain still sits deep somewhere inside. There are so many questions. So many thoughts. So much heartache. 'I will make a mother's plea for anyone who can tell us some information about the person who took my daughter and Eve Stratford's lives to come forward. Please, please give us some sort of closure.' Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh from Scotland Yard  said he was hopeful the killer had let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend or even a cellmate or medical professional. He said it is likely the suspect for both murders is now in his 60s or 70s. The glamour model was 22 when she was killed in her home and police said her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times . Police believe Lynne was followed on foot from Great Western Road into The Short Hedges (pictured right), before she was hit with a blunt instrument - her body was thrown over the fence and she was left for dead . Mr McHugh said detectives are keeping an open mind but have previously said it is possible the killer knew his victims, particularly Eve who had a huge circle of friends and acquaintances. He added: 'It's inconceivable the killer of Eve and Lynne has kept the perfect secret for 40 years. 18 March 1975: Playboy bunny Eve Stratford found  with her throat slashed at her home. 3 September 1975: Lynne Weedon, 16, was attacked and raped in an alleyway  at 11pm. 10 September 1975: Schoolgirl died in hospital from her injuries. July 2006: Murders linked in 2007 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims. March 2015: Police launched fresh appeal on the 40th anniversary of their deaths. April 2015: Detectives offer £40,000 reward for information about killings. 'It's a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend, even a cellmate - and I would appeal to anyone with information to contact us.' Mr McHugh appealed in particular to mental health professionals and prison officers who may have received disclosures from a patient or prisoner. Former Met Police detective Colin Sutton believes a third woman, Lynda Farrow - who was knifed to death in her home four years later in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer. Miss Stratford worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966. She was 22 when she was killed in her home and police said her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times. Detectives believe she may have known her killer and invited him into the flat she shared with her boyfriend Tony Priest, the lead singer with the pop band Onyx, who found her body. Miss Stratford (left) worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966 . This map shows the three unsolved murders all took place in close proximity - it is believed they are all linked . She was found dead in the bedroom of her flat at 5.30pm with a nylon stocking tied around one ankle and a scarf binding her hands behind her back. An hour earlier a neighbour had heard a male and female voice talking, apparently calmly, in her flat. There was no sign of forced entry. A blood-splattered bouquet of flowers she had bought earlier that day lay next to her body. She was last seen walking alone near her home in Lyndhurst Drive, Leyton, shortly before 4pm on a snowy day in March. Later that year Lynne was beaten over the head with a blunt object as she took a short-cut to her home in Hounslow. She was then thrown over a fence into the grounds of an electricity sub-station before being raped and left for dead. A school caretaker looking after the grounds found her still alive and she was taken to West Middlesex Hospital where she died a week later. The post-mortem examination found her skull was smashed with a heavy blunt instrument, but the weapon was never recovered.

In an emotional outburst during a concert Bobby appeared close to tears as he referenced his daughter's ongoing battle for her life.​ . ​The former husband of Whitney Houston looked tired and grief stricken at times during his performance, his first public appearance since Bobbi Kristina fell into a coma. Bobby Brown spoke for the first time about daughter Bobbi Kristina in Los Angeles on Saturday night and admitted: 'I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with ​it' The one-time boy band star shied away from talking in detail about his daughter but instead admitted these were 'rough times.' However, in an odd moment during his 45-minute set, he took time out to promote his kine of BBQ sauces. Bobby performed a set of his old hits for 4,000 fans at the Soul Food Festival ​in downtown Los Angeles ​on Saturday after months staying by his daughter Bobbi Kristina's side. Unresponsive: On January 31, Bobbi Kristina Brown was found unresponsive in her bathtub. She's been in a coma ever since . The 46-year-old was given the biggest cheer of the night as he took to the stage to play hits like Don't Be Cruel and ​On Our Own. ​After his drawn-out introduction Bobby, looking tired from performing dance moves, choked up as he said: 'I must ​tell y'all. This feels really, ​really really good. 'I want to thank all of y'all for coming out tonight​ to support me and my family. ​'Rough times are rough times, hard times are hard times I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with it.' ​Panting and sounding frustrated: '​There is only one thing I ask of you all tonight and that is enjoy yourselves.' Smiling he added: 'Don't be cruel, come on,' referring to one of his biggest hits​ the 80s. ​After a few other tunes, Bobby needed a break from the stage to rest while his boyband performed a number. Bobby needed a towel to wipe his face and often looked out of breath as he relived dance moves from his glory days. Later he was a little less emotional as fans cheered his performances of hits like Roni and Rock Witcha. Broke his silence: The former boy bander's appearance was booked before Bobbi Kristina fell into a coma. It was also Brown's first time discussing the matter in public . Had a booth: Brown told the LA crowd, 'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff to my new album to my new Edition to Heads Of States and I have been working on my food line; actually you all can get some food right there, in my booth' Looking toward his stand where his Bobby Brown BBQ cooking tent was set up at the festival, he told the crowd: 'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff, to my new album, to my new Edition to Heads Of States, and I have been working on my food line. Actually you all can get some food right there, in my booth. ​'​I will over there in a little bit​ later, if you want to buy some barb​e​cue sauce, seasonings, chicken and a couple of sausages. I don'​t know what my wife is cooking ​- whatever it, is is good. You have got to get the season​ing​, because the seasoning is off the chain, I must let you know.' ​Bobby then asked a bandmate to talk about another brand, but fired back: 'Mine is much better, low in sodium content​, low in salt for us folk if, you understand what I ​am saying. ​'So I made this for us.' Wiping away sweat from his face, he added: 'I ain't done with it yet. I got marinades and all kind of s*** coming out.' He then corrected himself: 'Excuse my French baby girl. I didn't mean to curse in front of you. And ladies too.' He then introduced his new ​R&B​ boy band band 'who can saanng.' 'You just listen and tell me if you like it.' Back to work: Brown's pregnant wife Alicia Etheredge was also at the food festival, selling Bobby Brown's BBQ sauce . Timing: The singer and barbecue entrepreneur was committed to the event before his daughter was hospitalized. He's also slated for a tour of Australia . ​Bobby's appearance marks his first time away from Bobbi in months. He had been scheduled to make the appearance before his daughter's accident. Bobbi remains hospitalized and in a coma after being found unconscious and face-down in a bathtub on January 31. The Soul Food Festival is among a string of appearances Bobby is contractually obligated to fulfill/ The singer is also scheduled to leave daughter Bobbi to tour in Australia. Even though he doesn't want to go, the promoters are holding the distraught father to his contractual obligation, TMZ reports. Bobbi Kristina remains on life support in a long-term care center in Atlanta, Georgia, after being treated at the city's Emory University Hospital where the ex-husband of Whitney Houston visits her regularly. Reportedly Bobby has the final say as to whether the young woman's support system is turned off. ​At the Festival 90s rap act Salt'N'Pepa had the crowd on their feet with their performance of Push It.","Broke down during Los Angeles concert as he talked about his daughter Bobbi Kristin, who has been in a coma since January 31 .

303,e944dba22ff1ad03fce3783cddb879fe67251b7b,"A celebrated Texas-born hunter was crushed to death by a baby elephant in Zimbabwe as he tried to measure its ivory tusks for an American client. Ian Gibson, 55, was a lauded figure among U.S. safari enthusiasts, who would commission him to slaughter prized animals near his home in South Africa. On Wednesday, he was tentatively approaching the young bull elephant in Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley when the animal charged, and knelt on Gibson until he died. Crushed to death: Ian Gibson, 55, was killed by a young bull elephant while measuring its ivory for a U.S. client . His American client, who was also present, has not been identified. The Dallas Safari Club is paying for Gibson's funeral. Despite only having one leg, Gibson was described by fans as 'fit and strong'. According to a statement from Safari Classics, posted on AfricaHunting.com, the group had stopped for a rest when the animal approached their group. Gibson and his tracker approached to assess its ivory. 'At very close range, Ian was able to get off one shot before the bull killed him. The scene was very graphic,' the statement read. Twitter users were widely pitiless, with hundreds of animal rights supporters commenting that he 'got what he deserved'. Lauded figure: Gibson, who lived in South Africa, was a popular figure in the U.S. safari enthusiast community . Backlash: Twitter users have been widely unsympathetic to Gibson's death in Zimbabwe on Wednesday . Tributes posted on the hunting forum slammed unsympathetic reactions to Gibson's death, describing the big game hunter as a 'magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist.' According to friends, he fired one shot at the young bull elephant, who was going through 'musth' - a period of high testosterone. The animal then charged. Gibson's trackers wrote on AfricaHunting.com: 'We know 'Gibbo' shot it once, from about 10 yards away, with a 458 [rifle]. 'He would never have fired unless he had no alternative. He was a hunter, yes, but he was also a magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist. Prized: Ivory tusks are some of the most prized treasures hunters can get, enraging animal rights supporters . 'He was so experienced and this is a most unexpected tragedy.' The news has come a month after a study was released warning that ivory hunting is continuing to diminish the elephant population in Africa. A report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which is known as CITES and regulates wildlife trade, said poaching rates of elephants in areas that are being monitored still exceed their natural birth rates. Conservationists say tens of thousands of elephants have been killed in Africa in recent years as demand for ivory in Asia, particularly China, increases. Past estimates of Africa's elephant population have ranged from 420,000 to 650,000. Prince William is one of the world's most prominent voices in defense of elephants against ivory hunters.","Ian Gibson, 55, was hunting in Zimbabwe for an American client .

A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which includes the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, as well as honouring Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. The seven-year-old came across the fossils at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile when he and his sister, Macarena were looking for decorative stones. They were playing at the site because their geologist parents, Manuel Suarez and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes mountain range. Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. However, more than a dozen specimens have now been excavated, including four skeletons, which demonstrate that the dinosaur combined a variety of unique anatomical traits. The dinosaur has been likened to a platypus, which is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom, because it's one of very few mammal to lay eggs, has venomous spurs and a paddle-shaped tail like a beaver, as well as webbed feet and a bill like a duck, among other idiosyncrasies. Most of the specimens discovered are the size of a turkey, but some isolated bones reveal the maximum size of Chilesaurus was around 10 feet (three metres) long, according to Chilean and Argentinian palaeontologists from institutions including the University of Birmingham who have studied the skeletons. Unusual: Fossils dating from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, reveal an unusual combination of features from various dinosaur groups, including relatively short arms, a long neck, small head and leaf-shaped teeth (pictured) Bizarre: Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics including its small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The dinosaur itself, has a lengthy neck and must have had good balance (illustrated) Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics. The Late Jurassic dinosaur lived 145 million years ago. It has a small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus, but has two blunt fingers instead of sharp claws, like the Velociraptor, for example. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon. It has leaf-shaped teeth, similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs. Most unusually, the animal was a vegetarian, despite belonging the theopod family of dinosaurs, which were mostly fierce meat eaters. The dinosaur ranged in size from as small as a turkey to 10 ft (three metres) long. They discovered that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod the Velociraptor. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon - whereas it is actually classified in the other basic dinosaur division – Saurischia, according to the study published in the journal Nature. The different parts of the body of Chilesaurus were adapted to a particular diet and way of life, which was similar to other groups of dinosaurs. As a result of these habits, different regions of the body of Chilesaurus evolved resembling those present in other, unrelated groups of dinosaurs - a phenomenon called evolutionary convergence. Chilesaurus represents one of the most extreme cases of evolutionary convergence. For example, its leaf-shaped teeth are similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs because they were selected over millions of years as a result of a similar diet between these two lineages of dinosaurs. 'Chilesaurus can be considered a ""platypus"" dinosaur because different parts of its body resemble those of other dinosaur groups due to mosaic convergent evolution,’ Martín Ezcurra, a researcher at the University of Birmingham explained. Painstaking: Close inspection of the fossils revealed that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod, the Velociraptor. The process of excavating the skeleton is shown . The presence of herbivorous theropods was, up until now, only known in close relatives of birds but Chilesaurus (illustrated left) shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than thought. Its fossils were found at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile, marked with a red star on the map, right . ‘In this process, a region or regions of an organism resemble others of unrelated species because of a similar mode of life and evolutionary pressures. ‘Chilesaurus provides a good example of how evolution works in deep time and it is one of the most interesting cases of convergent evolution documented in the history of life. 'Chilesaurus shows how much data is still completely unknown about the early diversification of major dinosaur groups.’ He believes that this study will force palaeontologists to take more care in identifying fragmented and isolated dinosaur bones. Dr Fernando Novas, of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires, Argentina, led the research on Chilesaurus. Seven-year-old Diego Suárez (pictured left) came across the fossils when he and his sister, Macarena, were looking for decorative stones. He was at the site while his his geologist parents, Manuel Suarez (pictured right) and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes . Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. Here, a palaeontologist painstakingly excavates the fossils . He said: ‘Chilesaurus is the first complete dinosaur from the Jurassic Period found in Chile and represents one of the most complete and anatomically correct documented theropod dinosaurs from the southern hemisphere. ‘Although plant-eating theropods have been recorded in North America and Asia, this is the first time a theropod with this characteristic has been found in a southern landmass. ‘Chilesaurus was an odd plant-eating dinosaur only to be found in Chile. ‘However, the recurrent discovery in beds of the Toqui Formation of its bones and skeletons clearly demonstrates that Chilesaurus was, by far, the most abundant dinosaur in southwest Patagonia 145 million years ago.' The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over the course of 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping the unlikely transformation. The tree showed that the branch of theropod dinosaurs, which gave rise to modern birds, were the only dinosaurs that kept getting smaller. The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping their unlikely transformation . Theropods, meaning ‘beast-footed’, were a group of dinosaurs which include the carnivorous dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. 'These bird ancestors also evolved new adaptations, such as feathers, wishbones and wings, four times faster than other dinosaurs,' said co-author Darren Naish, a palaeontologist at the University of Southampton. Lead author Associate Professor Michael Lee, from the University of Adelaide, said: 'Birds evolved through a unique phase of sustained miniaturisation in dinosaurs.' 'Being smaller and lighter in the land of giants, with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations, provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities, such as the ability to climb trees, glide and fly. ‘Ultimately, this evolutionary flexibility helped birds survive the deadly meteorite impact which killed off all their dinosaurian cousins.' Researchers examined over 1,500 anatomical traits of dinosaurs to reconstruct their family tree. They used mathematical modelling to trace evolving adaptions and changing body size over time and across dinosaur branches.","Chilesaurus diegosuarezi was discovered by a child in southern Chile .

LVL, which stands for length, volume and lift, flicks, curls and straightens lashes from the roots up so they appear much longer. 'It helps make my lashes darker and more voluminous,' says Michelle of the treatment, which takes an hour and a half and lasts over two months. The designer has been chanelling her passion for fashion into Lipsy ranges for several seasons now - and her success shows no sign of abating as she unveils yet another stylish range . The star, 27, says she's always been a fan of the range and has been using it for years so when they asked her to work with them, she was 'over the moon' The star also spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up. Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin. She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins serums and Garnier and Kiehl's moisturisers. In terms of her diet, Michelle has been using the SoulMateFood delivery service and says she will be continuing the healthy eating plan when she comes back to Manchester while filming over the next couple of weeks. Loved by Daisy Lowe and Una Foden, the alkaline food delivery service allows you to create your own healthy menus, which are delivered straight to your front door. 'It's perfect for me as I am always on the go at the moment and I can always have it with me,' she said of the meal service. When she's cooking for herself at home, Michelle starts the day with scrambled egg on brown toast with tomato, followed by a high protein banana smoothie with peanut butter. For lunch, she has a turkey or chicken salad sandwich on brown bread and dinner is salad with chicken or prawn. The flawless star, who found fame on Coronation Street, reveals that her simple but effective beauty secrets are  drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed . The actress likes to snack on fruit, nuts and her favourite treat: popcorn. Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I've been very busy at the moment but if I have time, I go to the gym 3-4 times per week.' She doesn't, however, do any cardio and simply sticks to weight training to tone up. 'Cardio is good for getting you sweating but it slims you down and I think it makes me look too skinny,' she admitted. She also swears by the 8-minute abs YouTube video, which she does when she gets home from the gym. As for the future, Michelle says she 'may consider' doing an accessories and jewellery range but for now, she's focussing on her acting duties. 'I start filming next week for new movie,' she revealed. 'I am also in talks for another film, so fingers crossed it will go well.' In between posing in beauty shoots and designing her own Lipsy range, Michelle has been filming for new projects and is in talks for a new movie .","Michelle unveils sneak peak of Lipsy designs ahead of launch on Wednesday .

308,4f8259a1e309eebecf63bd6c2687dc1d22db9491,"Help for Heroes has launched a fundraising drive to keep World War II veteran Robert Clark in his own home after a London council refused to pay for his ongoing care. Brent Council said it was no longer able to afford to pay for a live-in carer to stay with the 96-year-old former prisoner of war, despite the fact that Mr Clark spent his £50,000 life savings on contributing to his care. Now, the council want to move Mr Clark from the house he has lived in for the past 50 years into a care home because they claim it is cheaper. Scroll down for video . Help for Heroes has given Robbie Clark, pictured, an emergency grant so he can remain at home in London . The JustGiving paged more than half of the £5,000 target within a couple of hours of it going live this morning . However, Help for Heroes has launched its own JustGiving page to help Mr Clark. The charity has already given Mr Clark and emergency grant to fund his immediate care needs, but they are seeking the public's help to secure his future. They have so far raised £2,736.22 of the £5,000 needed. Any extra money will go towards the care of other former servicemen and women in need of assistance. Linda Walton, head of grants at Help for Heroes, said: 'Help for Heroes is all about supporting those who have been psychologically or physically wounded in service of our country. 'Robbie suffered severe anxiety and distress as a prisoner of war during the Second World War, and it is wrong that he should be subject to these feelings once again. 'We will do everything we can to ensure Robbie gets the support he deserves.' Mr Clark is one of Britain's oldest surviving prisoners of war  - and one of the few British soldiers to survive Hitler's 1,000-mile death march - has been given the emergency grant through the Help for Heroes quick reaction fund. Having spent his savings on home care, Mr Clark, from Brent, north west London, faced being forced out of his home into a residential care home, something he said would 'remind me of being a prisoner of war'. Mr Clark is blind, deaf in one ear and dependent on a wheelchair, suffered 'severe anxiety' when he was a prisoner of war. A total of 165,000 people have signed a petition calling for home help, the charity said. More than £2,500 has been donated on a JustGiving fundraising page. Mr Clark was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942. He spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Poland, before being forced to join the ‘death march’ in 1945. Hitler ordered thousands of PoWs to march west for four months in extreme winter weather as the Russians advanced from the East. Writing home: Veteran Robert Clark, pictured in 1940, when he was serving with Durham Light Infantry . Robert Clark (front row, second left) pictured on June 21, 1943 at prisoner of war camp Campo PG70 in Italy . After the war, the soldier married his sweetheart Rita and worked as a carpenter. In 1969 the couple moved into the house where he still lives in Burnt Oak, north London. Mrs Clark died in 2010 aged 91. Now a great-great-grandfather and one of Britain’s oldest surviving PoWs, Mr Clark is registered blind, deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair. For the past two years he has used his £50,000 savings to pay towards a £960-a-week live-in carer, while Brent Council contributed £350 a week. But as his money runs out, the council is refusing to increase its funding and Mr Clark may have to go into a care home instead. His son, Mike, who said his home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is not suitable for the pensioner, added: ‘This is causing my father to be very anxious and he is unable to sleep. ‘He’s as good as told me that if he has to move, he’ll just give up on life. Whenever he’s been in hospital, he … pulls the blankets over his head and stops talking. ‘He hates being anywhere which isn’t familiar … going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp.’ Despite tens of thousands signing the petition to allow Mr Clark to stay in his own home, Brent Council said they will not increase their funding for a live-in carer. The council’s Phil Porter said: ‘We recognise Mr Clark’s contribution to this country and sincerely empathise with the situation that he and other older people … are in. ‘However … the care package that Mr Clark is choosing is not affordable to council taxpayers given the constraints of local government funding and the need to be consistent for the 2,900 people we support.’ He added: ‘Mr Clark owns his home, so there is absolutely no question of Brent Council evicting him despite what has been suggested in this petition.’ The council said Mr Clark’s needs can be met in a care home for £451 a week. Alternatively, he could choose to receive the same weekly sum and stay at home, but would have to pay the extra amount necessary for a carer. Mr Porter said: ‘We want to find a solution which meets his eligible social care needs, provides value for money for the taxpayer, but also reflects the choices he has made and the additional cost this creates.’ He added that the council had offered ‘a deferred payment which means he doesn’t need to sell his house to pay for his care’. After signatures hit the 127,000 mark this morning, a spokeswoman said: 'Our position hasn't changed since the petition was at 75,000.' Mr Clark’s family reported the case to the Local Government Ombudsman, but the watchdog agreed with the council.","Great-grandfather Robert Clark has lived in the house for 50 years .

309,39816732fdc433c5d126feed54f8bb12867bb4e5,"The scene in the Old Government House Hotel could not be further removed from the horrors of war. There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served, a clink of cutlery on crockery, the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups. Somewhere outside, the clouds part and light floods the lounge. I reach for another scone, ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream, and marvel that, in this context, 70 years seems an eternity. Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey's only five-star hotel – pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port – would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere. Seventy years on: St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival . During the German occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945), this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters. Invading officers would have stalked its corridors. By April 1945, they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin, and the Channel Islands – bypassed by the D-Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation. That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month – and with gusto. The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival (3 April–11 May) is a five-week hurrah of history, parades, concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago – Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, Herm and Sark. This is no small feat. Fiercely individual, the islands have never before combined to stage a big event. But here they have common cause. Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey's capital St Helier into swirls of people and music. It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey's harrowing half-decade. The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline – the swarthy, sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north. Intrigued, I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower, on the south-west shore. It is an oddly unnerving experience, the pillar-box slots in the bastion's sides eyeing me quietly. When I face the water, I almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine-gun barrel on my neck. Coastal curves: Guernsey's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of Portelet Bay . You can go further into Guernsey's wartime heritage. What appears to be a car park behind La Colinette Hotel on the western outskirts of St Peter Port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the Channel Islands. Hidden down a damp flight of stairs, the former German Naval Signals Headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there. This, of course, was the point. Its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter, semaphore murmur and serious conversation. German signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls. The bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival – its secrets brought into the light. The German Occupation Museum at Les Houards offers further perspective, flitting from frivolity to fear – on one hand the photo album of Freda Oliver, a local girl who dated (and married) a German officer; on the other, exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island's Jewish population, and copies of the Guernsey Evening Press turned to propaganda sheet. The darkness of life under Nazi rule is most obvious at the German Military Underground Hospital, at La Vassalerie. This enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave-labour sweat of prisoners of war – plenty of whom died in the process. As did many of the injured German troops brought here from France after the D-Day landings. With its dank passages and horror-film ambience, the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building. An island guardian: Mont Orgueil Castle has protected the east coast of Jersey since the 13th century . The picture is replicated 27 miles to the south-east. Jersey is a short hop from Guernsey – around an hour by fast ferry, less by air. Here, the Jersey War Tunnels – another military-medical complex – have been restored into something less frightening, with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels. The side-effects of occupation can be seen here – the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies. But so can the joy that liberation brought. Glorious video footage shows euphoria in St Helier as the news of German surrender broke; the Union Jack being hoisted at the Pomme D'Or Hotel. The hotel came to symbolise the Channel Islands' moment of deliverance. In a way, it still does, peering across what is now called Liberation Square, where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag – laughing, as if they are flying a kite. Other echoes resound across St Helier. The Jersey Museum and Art Gallery has a catalogue of copies of the Jersey Evening Post dating back 125 years, its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail (albeit through a fog of strict German control). The nearby Maritime Museum proffers the Occupation Tapestry Gallery – a montage of bright images, stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995, which depict Jersey brought to heel – armed troops in the streets, the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire. And the Jersey Archive is host to a remarkable resource – over 30,000 of the Occupation Registration Cards which were forced on islanders by the Nazi authorities. There are no smiles here – just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces. Bright days ahead: A view of the pretty coastal enclave of Gorey from the ramparts of Mont Orgueil Castle . The heaviness of the German bootprint is perhaps summed up by Battery Lothringen – a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite. This colossal bunker – which will also be accessible during the festival – 'protected' St Helier from the far side of St Aubin's Bay. The stairs into its depths seem to go down forever, to gun posts, control rooms and sleeping quarters – the decades peeling away as I walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy. And yet, just seven miles north-west, it all feels like a bad dream. St Brelade's Bay Hotel gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner. In the summer of 1940, it was another German outpost, requisitioned as a hang-out by Luftwaffe pilots. It is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted. Over breakfast, I peer out of the wide restaurant windows – at waves rolling gently up to the beach, and at St Brelade's, a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand. There is no stomp of marching boots this morning – but for five weeks, the Channel Islands are remembering a time when there was.

However they were amazed to find the man had actually swallowed hundreds of coins and nails. Over a three year period Rajpal Singh, 34, had swallowed 140 coins, 150 nails and a handful of nuts, bolts and batteries. He had also gulped down screws, nails and magnets. Rajpal Singh, 34, had hundreds of coins and other objects removed from his stomach after complaining of an ache. The image shows an X-ray with the mass of metal objects shown in white in his stomach . Doctors were amazed when an endoscopy (a long thin tube with a camera attached) revealed hundreds of foreign objects inside Mr Singh's stomach. The endoscopy is pictured . Over a three year period, Mr Singh had swallowed, 140 coins, 150 nails and nuts and bolts, batteries and magnets. Some of the objects removed are pictured . When doctors carried out an endoscopy – inserting a long, thin, tube with a camera attached to the end – it revealed the hundreds of foreign objects in his stomach. Mr Singh, a farmer from Bathinda in India's western state of Punjab, said his bizarre habit began after he fell into a depression, and eating metal objects brought him comfort. He said: 'I used to gulp down coins and metals with fruit juice or milk. 'Due to family problems I had slipped into depression and got hooked onto this weird habit. 'Doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and I would have eventually died. 'I feel much more relaxed now. I am never going to do this again.' Mr Singh claims he didn't realise his stomach pain was due to his habit of eating metal objects. Doctors have carried out 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects, as well as a nine-hour operation. But Mr Singh will still need another procedure to remove the rest of the metal . Pictured are X-rays of Mr Singh's stomach, revealing the mass of foreign objects. Mr Singh said: 'Doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and I would have eventually died' Dr Gagendeep Goyal (pictured centre in blue) led a team of five doctors who carried out the operation to remove the objects from Mr Singh's abdomen . He went to many medical centres in Punjab complaining of a painful ache in his abdomen, but no doctors could diagnose the problem. Finally, Dr Gagandeep Goyal, a gastroentologist at a local hospital, carried out an X-ray and revealed the mass of metal deep in Mr Singh's stomach. He has since carried out more than 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects - yet some still remain. Leading a team of  five doctors, he also carried out a nine hour operation to remove more of the metal, yet Mr Singh will still need another operation to remove the rest. Dr Goyal said: 'The patient came to us with severe stomach pain. When we did the endoscopy we were shocked to see so many foreign bodies, including coins and sharp objects in his stomach. 'Though we have managed to remove most of them, there are still sharp injects and coins in his stomach. 'His body is too fragile to sustain another operation now so we plan to operate again in about seven days and remove the remaining objects.' Mr Singh says he feels calmer now and will not swallow metal objects again.

311,2059c7857d0d456a01bca2936dce366b65dc9132,"A Canadian prostitute says that she wishes  other people wouldn't make her feel so ashamed of working in the sex industry - because she actually really enjoys her job. Celine Bisette, who uses this pseudonym whenever she is discussing her career, insists she is neither 'damaged' nor 'deranged' - that, in fact, she rather enjoys being a prostitute, and it's only the social stigma surrounding her career choice that leaves her feeling unhappy. 'I am embarrassed to be a sex worker, even though I like my job, I’m good at it, and I’ve made exceptional progress in my career over the past few years,' she wrote in a recent essay for xoJane. This pro has pride: Canadian prostitute Celine Bisette, pictured here, wishes other people wouldn't make her feel embarrassed about her job . First, Celine would like everyone to abandon whatever assumptions they've made about prostitutes. She claims that she didn't have an abusive childhood, she's not a 'hyper-sexual nympho', and she isn't uneducated. She had 'an incredibly fortunate upbringing', she said, adding that she got along well with her parents and older sister: '[It was] just about the best any child could possibly hope for.' Then, as a 19-year-old college sophomore, she found herself in need of a way to pay for school. A minimum-wage job wouldn't earn her enough money, and she didn't want to take out student loans. Her best option, she said, was the sex industry. 'I couldn’t bring myself to do porn, and I knew wasn’t talented enough to be a stripper,' she explained. Working as an escort seemed like a natural choice for Celine, as it was easy and it paid well - seeing just one or two clients a week covered her bills. It just didn't occur to her that others might not be so at ease with her decision. In the beginning, she'd readily tell people at parties what she did for part-time work. She was still out-going then, she said, and never felt self-conscious. But peoples' reactions quickly changed the way she approached conversations about her job. They would lecture her, insult her, and accuse her of being a 'traitor to feminism'. One friend told everyone in their social circle that Celine must be mentally unstable to have chosen such a career, and might have even been molested as a child. The rumor took off, and Celine lost a lot of friends in the process. Now, after about a decade in the industry, she is much more reticent about revealing what she does, for fear of eliciting those same negative reactions. But while she has a 'mainstream' part-time job that she uses as a 'cover', she finds it frustrating that she can't be more open. 'I wish I could feel proud of who I am and what I do,' she said. 'I’m tired of feeling embarrassed and ashamed.' Sexy and smart: Celine, who wants to keep her real identity a secret, says she's more than just an escort - she also has her master's degree in sociology . Even when she does tell people about her work as an escort, Celine makes a point to emphasize that she also has a master’s degree in sociology: 'I hype it up and draw attention to it, as if to say, “Yes, I’m a [prostitute], but I’m also smart and normal, really, I promise!”' Because of the social stigma, she sometimes thinks about quitting altogether - but she hesitates because the work is easy, her schedule is flexible, and she makes twice as much as she would doing a job in her field of study. Plus, she explained, she can't erase her history in the sex industry. 'I will always be seen as damaged goods, whether I am a current sex worker or a former one. So I might as well just keep going, right?' In fact, despite liking her job, it's not Canada's ambiguous laws on prostitution that give Celine pause - being paid for sex is legal, but living off that payment of it is not. Rather, it's the negative reactions to her job that make her regret ever taking up sex work at all. 'I wish I’d known what I was getting myself into before I jumped into this line of work,' she said. 'But most of all, I wish I’d never become a prostitute in the first place.'","Celine Bisette, from Canada, became an escort when she was in college .

312,3f034e41bd128350195c9dd75a74258f86b1fd06,"Los Angeles (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" earlier this year. In addition to that ruling, Judge Ronald Coen also lowered Knight's bail to $10 million from $25 million, a figure that defense lawyers called excessive. The judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against Knight. In all, Knight will stand trial on one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run, the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended Thursday. Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted. Knight suffers diabetes and blot clots, and the case has clearly strained him: He collapsed in court last month after learning of the $25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment. Knight was in court Thursday. At the end of hearing, he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery, and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom. In a press conference after the hearing, fiancee Toi Kelly said regarding Knight's health that he is ""doing much better."" The judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because California law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon, in this case the vehicle Knight was driving, is used against several people. Knight is accused of running over two men, killing one of them, during an argument. Killed was Terry Carter, 55. The survivor is Cle Sloan, 51, who in testimony this week declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan doesn't want to be a ""snitch"" who sends Knight to prison, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity, but he still refused to testify against Knight on Monday, the affiliates reported. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. At the time, Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case. The hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows Knight inside a red truck. In the video, the truck pulls into the entrance of the Compton restaurant, and he is then approached by Sloan, who was working security on the site. The two men appear to talk for a few moments, with Knight still in his vehicle. Suddenly, the vehicle backs up, knocking Sloan to the ground. While still in reverse, the truck moves out of range of the security camera. The vehicle is then seen zooming forward, back into camera range, running over Sloan a second time, and then running over a second man, Carter, a former rap music label owner. Carter later died. In closing arguments prior to the judge's ruling, Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher argued that Knight was the victim. Knight was only defending himself against Sloan, whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time. ""Mr. Sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor,"" Knight's attorney argued. ""There's no intent to kill, there's an intent to survive."" ""Even without a gun, we know Mr. Sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight,"" the defense attorney said. Fletcher added that Knight's defense was to stand his ground. Sloan ""needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor,"" Fletcher said. ""He is the person who got Terry (Carter) killed."" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes argued, however, told the judge that Knight was engaged in ""mutual combat situation"" where he used his car as deadly weapon. If Knight ""ever had the right of self-defense, the moment he backed-up and Mr. Sloan was ran-over, he lost the right of self-defense,"" Barnes said. ""There was pre-mediation and intent when he (Knight) ran over him a second time."" Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (now known as Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards.","Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight will be tried for murder in a videotaped hit-and-run .

In years following, it was really trial and error and learning the hard way.' Chapple revealed during the 2012 interview a motivation to preserve the way the world looks for his family. He told Landscape Photography Magazine 'The biggest moment of clarity as a photographer came with the birth of my first son, Radley Danger Chapple (yes, Danger really is his middle name). 'After a conversation with my father-in-law about how visibility in the mountains has decreased so much in his lifetime because of air pollution, I suddenly felt a real urgency to capture images that my children can share with their grandchildren.

As the canine scampers along, his passenger holds tightly to a leash. Two men watching the bizarre scene from their car are heard chuckling in the background. They're forced to slow down  to avoid hitting the animal and human train. Once the dog reaches the other side of the road, it makes its way over a muddy verge. At that point the boy gets up and stumbles forwards. Another pedestrian is seen on the roadside but he doesn't appear to be overly fazed by the scene.

The incident took place in Olani village, four kilometres from Manpur, in central India and was recorded by terrified villagers from the relative safety of hut rooftops. To try and protect his fellow villagers, the fearless ward ran towards the leopard brandishing the weapon. The brave village watchman stands on guard with his stick as the leopard moves towards him . Watched on by a crowd of bystanders, the ward beats the leopard twice on the head as it tries to slash him with its claws . Even though the man sits defenceless on the dusty earth, he continues to fend off the leopard with his stick . After a few terrifying seconds, the leopard - inches away from the man's bare feet - eventually runs off . He managed to strike the big cat on the head twice before it retaliated, dumping the ward to the ground. Astonished bystanders could be heard screaming as the leopard stood at the feet of the seemingly doomed man. Despite being injured on the floor and unable to move, the courageous ward continued to fend off the leopard with his stick and after a few seconds the animal ran off. Mahendra Sharma, a school teacher, said: 'Even the armed forest officials seldom muster courage to fight a beast.' According to local media, the man did not suffer any serious injuries as a result of his death-defying encounter. In last year's Indian elections, rural communities blamed the government for placing them at risk of leopard attacks by failing to provide basic infrastructure such as electrical lighting and street lighting.

It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure. A separate study, also commissioned by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoors thinking they were not at risk from the sun and sunburn or were unsure if they were. The study found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoorst hinking they were not at risk . The institution urged businesses to improve 'sun safety', for example by minimising workers' exposure in the middle of the day. More than half (59%) of those questioned reported having had sunburn - a major contributor to skin cancer - at least once in the last year. Researchers also found a 'macho culture' in some parts of the industry and misconceptions about the threat of ultraviolet radiation in climates like the UK's as cloud cover does not give total protection from the sun. The studies' findings are being published as part of an Institution of Occupational Safety and Health No Time To Lose campaign to beat work-related cancers, with businesses urged to develop 'sun safety strategies'. It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure . The strategies should include regular updates on the UV index from weather forecasts, minimising sun exposure in the middle of the day and asking employees to wear long-sleeved, loose-fitting tops and trousers. While using high-factor sunscreen is helpful it should not be relied on as the only barrier to the harmful rays, employers are advised. IOSH executive director of policy Shelley Frost said: 'We've a clear picture for the UK now of the number of people diagnosed with or dying from skin cancer because of sun exposure at work. 'It's a terrible disease but with some simple measures we can ensure people who work outside are not exposed to the solar radiation that causes it.

318,1695970eb33fa22c46048addc4185fd7dcc73283,"Washington (CNN)The U.S. said Tuesday that deploying warships to Yemen to monitor nearby Iranian vessels has given America ""options"" for how it could react to Iran's behavior in the region. The warships are being deployed to monitor ships traveling from Iran that could be trafficking arms to Houthi rebels in Yemen, U.S. officials told CNN, saying the move was also meant to reassure allies in the region. ""By having American sea power in the region, we have created options for ourselves,"" said Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren. He noted that the nine ships in the Iranian convoy were cargo ships, but he declined to specify what they were carrying beyond ""containers."" International officials are concerned that Iran could surreptitiously attempt to transfer weaponry to the Houthis. President Barack Obama told MSNBC that the United States has been clear in its messages to Tehran on sending weapons to Houthi rebels inside Yemen. ""What we've said to them is if there are weapons delivered to factions within Yemen that could threaten navigation, that's a problem,"" Obama said in the interview, a clip of which aired on NBC Nightly News. ""We're not sending them obscure messages, we send them very direct messages about it,"" Obama said. While the Iranian ships remain in international waters, the U.S. and other partner nations can keep an eye on the Iranian ships to see if they move toward Yemeni territorial waters. But it would be an extraordinary step and certainly not a foregone conclusion that the U.S. would attempt to board an Iranian ship if it entered Yemeni waters, U.S. officials said. ""I want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression. They are not there to intercept Iranian ships,"" State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters Tuesday. ""The purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe."" Warren too added that he was unaware of any direct contact between the American and Iranian vessels at this point. The Obama administration and U.S. defense officials maintain the primary purpose of positioning additional U.S. warships in the region is to ensure the free flow of commerce through established international shipping lanes and to ensure maritime security in the region. There is a message for Iran as well. A U.S. military official told CNN that aircraft from aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt are also conducting ""manned reconnaissance"" to monitor all maritime traffic moving through the area the Roosevelt is operating in to determine what is going on there in order to assist in making informed decisions. This official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships in the region was taken in order to assure the freedom of navigation through established international shipping lanes and ensuring maritime security and not to interdict Iranian ships. The Roosevelt aircraft carrier and the guided missile cruiser USS Normandy were the two ships the Navy moved into the waters off the coast of Yemen on Sunday. At this stage, there are nine U.S. naval ships operating off the coast in Yemen. ""The United States alongside the international community, including the United Nations, is serious about the Iranians not providing weapons to the Houthis,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday. ""Providing weapons to the Houthis only exacerbates the violence and instability in this region in a way that will have continued terrible impact on the humanitarian situation in the country."" The heightened tensions could have broader consequences for the relationship between the U.S. and Iran, coming weeks after the announcement of a framework agreement to limit Iran's nuclear program. Officials on Capitol Hill and elsewhere pointed out that the situation in Yemen adds an additional challenge when it comes to reaching a final deal. ""I don't think this changes something directly, but it does highlight that Iran has a number of activities around the region and around the world that are problematic,"" Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN Tuesday. ""It includes their missile program, it includes their growing influence in Iraq, it includes their propping up of (President Bashar al-) Assad in Syria and their fueling this war in Yemen."" U.S. warships from the carrier group of the Roosevelt are joining allied vessels from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other partner nations prepared to intercept a convoy of seven to nine Iranian vessels believed headed for Yemen. ""We are closely monitoring all maritime activity in the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden,"" Cmdr. Kevin Stephens of the Fifth Fleet told CNN. ""We not going discuss the number and types of vessels we are monitoring or speculate about the possible destination or cargo of those vessels."" When asked about warnings from Saudi Arabia and the U.S. to keep Iranian navy ships away from Yemen, the commander of Iran's Regular Navy, Flotilla Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, said his fleet was operating legally. ""We don't let anyone give us warnings and threats, because we are working according to international law and regulations,"" he said. ""And we work for the security of our country and other countries."" Sayyari added that Iranian navy ships in the area were there to combat piracy and secure the safe transfer of goods through the waters. U.S. ships do not have authority to forcibly board Iranian-flagged ships. Earlier this month, a U.S. Navy ship consensually boarded a Panamanian-flagged vessel suspected of trafficking people, drugs or weapons. Nothing was found. The U.S. warships come to a region seeing a good deal of U.S. military activity. The Roosevelt in particular only recently arrived in the theater and had been in the Arabian Gulf supporting Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria, according to Stephens. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on the ""Situation Room"" that he would only endorse U.S. air power against Yemen if it was the only option. ""It is a very serious escalatory step,"" he said on Monday. ""If you're going to use U.S. air power, what else is going to happen to make sure you stop the Houthis?"" McCain blamed President Barack Obama's foreign policy for the deteriorating situation. ""It was very obvious to many of us that this did not have to happen,"" McCain said. ""We did not take care of the regime that was in place, the president that was in there. It is a symptom of our failure throughout the Middle East."" CNN's Jim Acosta, Frederik Pleitgen, Theodore Schleifer and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","U.S. Navy moves aircraft carrier, cruiser to waters near Yemen .

So it comes as a surprise that the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - located along the no-man's land between the North and South - is next to a burgeoning surf spot for South Korean hipsters, gangsters, ex-pats and its jet-setting adventure class. Photos captured at the site show an eclectic mix of people going about their day-to-day duties, where fishermen and day-trippers are placed alongside soldiers, tanks and their fortified military installations. The DMZ was established in 1953 as a buffer zone to separate the North from the South. Surfer Shannon Aston, from New Zealand, said he felt compelled to start photographing the area while he was living and working in South Korea as a teacher. Mr Aston added: 'The military is ever present and must be respected and everybody does (respect it), but Korea has been divided for decades, so life just goes on. 'There was never much tension, only when people in the north would defect near that coast or security was ramped up after a skirmish or incident between the two countries.' The beaches, often filled with foreigners and day-trippers from the capital Seoul, features an 'overlapping' of military installations along the coast as it nears the border with the north, he said.

321,a7508622f7e499c3ea0e38837059e942b868ff51,"Bingo hall toilets have tested positive for traces of Class A drugs amid evidence that an increasing number of pensioners are turning to hard drugs in retirement. Out of 17 bingo halls tested seven showed traces of cocaine, while another had traces of crack cocaine, a more dangerous form of the drug that is smoked, a newspaper investigation revealed. While the venues do let players as young as 18 in, the majority of attendees are elderly, and the discoveries mirror a spike in OAPs being treated for drug abuse. Out of 17 bingo halls tested across the country, seven had traces of cocaine in the toilets, while this one, in Hengrove Leisure Park, Bristol, was found to have traces of crack cocaine . Class A: While bingo halls allow people as young as 18 to visit, the majority of visitors are pensioners (pictured, Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol, where traces of cocaine were found in the toilets) Figures from Public Health England show that 634 pensioners over 65 were treated for substance abuse in the last year, a rise of 20 per cent in a year, and double the rates seen in 2009. A probe by The Sun used swabs coated with special chemicals which reveal traces of cocaine to test toilet cubicles in bingo halls around the country. The news comes as hospital figures reveal a spike in drug abuse among the elderly, with 634 treated for addiction last year (stock picture) Two Gala Bingo premises in Clydebank Retail Park and Hawthorne Quadrant, Glasgow, tested positive for the drug, while Mecca Bingo in Coral Island, Blackpool, also showed traces of cocaine. Gala Bingo in Basildon and Mecca Bingo in Romford, Essex, also had positive results, as did Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol. Another Bristol venue, Gala Bingo in Hengrove Leisure Park, tested positive for crack cocaine, which is highly addictive. Kate Lawrence, of drug charity Phoenix Futures, told the paper’s Grant Rollings that the findings were unsurprising, adding that many older people turn to drugs to combat loneliness, or to socialise. She said: 'We assume older people don't want to go out and socialise, but they do, particularly if they are lonely. Loneliness is a massive trigger for drugs. 'The older generation isn't so well informed because we have concentrated on warning young people about drugs. Representatives from both Mecca Bingo and Gala Bingo said that their companies took a zero-tolerance policy on drugs and banned taking them on their premises. Figures released early last year showed that, as well as record numbers of pensioners being hospitalised with drug problems, thousands more were seeking help to kick the habit. Busted: Mecca Bingo Blackpool was among the eight premises where traces of Class A drugs were found . Zero tolerance: Both Gala Bingo and Mecca Bingo said drug taking was banned in both of their venues (pictured, Gala Bingo in Basildon, where cocaine traces were discovered) More than 2,000 people in their 60s, 70s and 80s sought help for problems relating to substance abuse in 2013 - double the number that were receiving treatment only five years ago. The dramatic rise is being blamed on those who first experimented with drugs during the 1960s, and have continued to use them on and off over the subsequent decades. The majority of those requesting help last year suffered from addictions to heroin or crack cocaine, although there were significant numbers who had problems with cannabis, amphetamines and prescription medications.","Out of 17 bingo halls tested, seven revealed traces of cocaine in toilets .

The four men appeared in turn in a courtroom in Dartmouth, near Halifax, where they were given identical but unusual bail conditions that could see them having to live on a Canadian naval base for the next few years. Bail was set at over £2,000 for each of them but they also agreed to surrender their passports and live at the nearby Stadacona naval base in Halifax. Accused: Joshua Finbow, 23, a submarine engineer from Stockbridge, Hampshire, arrives at court today . Two of the accused, Simon Radford, 31, of Gosport, Hampshire and Craig Stoner, 24, from Stonehouse, Gloucestershire hid their faces as they were led to a provincial court in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia . Darren Smalley, 35, of Gosport, Hampshire, and his co-accused were ordered to surrender their passports as part of their bail conditions . In a deal agreed with the British government, they will also continue to work for the Royal Navy and draw their current pay. It was not clear last night how they will keep themselves occupied thousands of miles from their shipmates and a representative from the British High Commission who was in court refused to elaborate. The four – Joshua Finbow, 23, a submarine engineer, Craig Stoner, 24, Simon Radford, 31, and Darren Smalley, 35 – had been playing for the Royal Navy ice hockey team in a tournament at the Shearwater naval base just east of Halifax. The alleged sexual assault, in which police sources say all four men had sexual intercourse with their victim, took place on April 10 after the sailors had returned to the barracks from a hockey game. Sources say their victim, who is aged in her early 20s and lives in Halifax, had accompanied a friend who had been invited to attend the party by local Canadian servicemen. Yesterday, all four men – three of them wearing black Royal Navy ice hockey team hoodies – looked relieved to be getting out of custody as they respectfully answered Judge John MacDougall’s questions. Charged: Royal Navy sailors Joshua Finbow, 23, (left) and Simon Radford, 31, (right) appeared in court . Held: Craig Stoner, 24, (left) and Darren Smalley, 35, (right) are being held by military police in Canada . They all said they understood their bail conditions and Crown prosecutor Eric Taylor said outside court that the accused had not asked to be returned to the UK. They were ordered to return to court on May 27 and given the names of seven people – the victim and six witnesses – who they were forbidden to contact. They must not leave the province of Nova Scotia and cannot apply for new passports. They must remain employed by the navy and must not resign without the court’s permission. The four, no longer trying to hide their faces, later filed out of the court building and were driven away together in a large white SUV to their new home on the close Stadacona base. They ignored a question over how they might plead in the case. Commander Michael O’Sullivan, the air and naval advisor at the British High Commission, has spoken to the four and described the alleged offences as ‘serious’ but stressed they were as yet only allegations.

325,d467b8bd70dc904ceaa43cd5804b29cf9cb205c6,"When Nic Newling recalls his childhood, he remembers misleading highs and deep depressions where the only option he could see for himself was committing suicide. But it was the unexpected and tragic death of his teenage brother, Christopher, who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective. Now, the 28-year-old is using his story of loss and confusion - in which he moved between doctors and psychiatric wards and was fed various concoctions of prescriptive medication before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - to raise awareness of mental illness. Mental health advocate Nic Newling struggled through the confusing highs and depressing lows of an undiagnosed bipolar disorder between the ages of 13 and 18 . It was the unexpected and tragic death of his older, teenage brother Christopher (pictured right with Nic left), who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective . Academically driven from a young age, Nic said that the time he was eight years old, he had planned his whole life out in his mind with the intention of becoming a vet. 'I got into a high school with a scholarship; at that point I was really happy for the first six months, but I pushed myself too hard and put an unrealistic amount of pressure on myself and just crashed. What it looked like was not having any other interests, being snappy and grumpy and angry - which are all things that are not like me at all,' he told Daily Mail Australia. His bad moods progressed into forms of anxiety and depression and what Nic described as an 'overwhelming sadness that didn't come from any particular place', before taking on a level of psychosis. 'When things first started getting bad, I was experiencing symptoms of agitation, panic attacks, I was withdrawing from friends and life and not finding pleasure in the things that I used to find pleasurable, I was experiencing what I thought was OCD behaviors and I started thinking I was hearing things that weren't real,' he said. Both Nic (left) and Christopher (centre, with eldest brother Ben right) suffered from mental health problems at the same time . Unlike Nic (left), Christopher (with Ben right) was not as open about his emotions and his anxiety and depression. His death came as a shock to the family who had been focusing on Nic's struggles . 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. 'I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room.' By year eight, Nic had admitted himself into a psychiatric ward - a move that marked the beginning of years of confusions and various treatments including electroconvulsive therapy - in a desperate bid to rid himself of his confusing emotions. 'On average, statistics show that it takes 20 years for someone with bipolar to go from having the symptoms to being diagnosed - and that's not even treating it,' Nic said. 'Compared to that, I'm one of the lucky ones.' A high achiever from a young age, Nic (pictured left and right) 'crashed' after pushing himself too hard in the first year of high school . His anxiety and depression progressed into a type of psychosis and he soon admitted himself into a psychiatric ward for almost nine months . But along with the cold, stale, square rooms, the psychiatric wards offered a surprising comfort: other people who were not afraid to talk about mental illness. 'I really liked that psych ward. I didn't want to leave because I met so many people there from different backgrounds and religions and with different ideas about the world … and the reason I really got along with these guys was because it was the first time I had met other people with mental health issues and that it was such a non-issue. 'They'd be like ""what have you got?"" and I'd say ""I think I have psychosis or depression"" and they'd just say ""OK, cool. Do you want to play Nintendo now?"" That planted the seed a little bit: maybe talking about this stuff is really helpful, not damaging.' The level of support and acceptance of mental health problems that Nic experienced was a far cry from the experience of his older brother Christopher. 'Everyone was really worried about me being suicidal because it was such a measured thought-out decision for me - I was sort of at the point where I was convinced there was no point in living but couldn't deal with the guilty because my family had been so good to me,' Nic said. 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic (pictured) was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun . 'Then Chris ended up killing himself when I had just turned 16 and he was just shy of 18. 'He had his heart set on being a professional rugby player but had some problems with his legs and had to get surgery. He was bed ridden for a while and that made his depression and anxiety a lot worse because he pretty much just lived for rugby. 'He became withdrawn: he wouldn't talk about his depression. I was open about it to close friends and family whereas he would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man. Devastated by the unexpected turn of events, Nic's eldest brother was left to organize Christopher's funeral while his mother became a recluse and the rest of the family tried to shield Nic from the event, desperate to avoid another tragedy. Christopher's (left and right) mental health problems peaked after a surgery that left him bed ridden and unable to play rugby: 'He would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man' 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness. 'After he died there were five chairs at the dinner table and only four people and you can't ignore that. We started having dinner in front of the television permanently because, what do you talk about? How can you discuss anything and have that chair sitting there?' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun. His death shattered their family: 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness,' Nic said (pictured from a young age with his brothers and father) 'Our first family Christmas in a very long time, just last year': Left to right Ben and his son Zach, mum, dad, Nic's best friend Ryle, Nic, and family friend Daisy . 'I'd had heaps of different meds for heaps of different diagnosis. I'd had shock therapy when I was 16 which was once I'd had every meds that existed for the condition and meant we were really scraping the bottom of the barrel by falling back on like 1960s meds,' he said. 'But it wasn't that the meds weren't working or the dosage was wrong, it was that I was being treatment for something I didn't have.' 'Now things are good. I take a small maintenance dose of medication, one pill a day, with no side effect: a mood stabilizer which just feels like taking a vitamin. I've got a great job working in mental health, I live with my best friend, have a great girlfriend - I don't want to say it's perfect, but what a dramatic turnaround!' As an outspoken advocate for mental health and suicide prevention who advocates loudly about the importance of seeking help, Nic aims to raise awareness about the importance of GPs - the front-line of any mental health help and diagnosis - brushing up on mental illness research and data to improve diagnoses .

The UCO Stormproof Matches are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to them and will start burning again once they come into contact with oxygen. The unique matches have to go through rigorous testing to make sure they keep alight in even the most difficult situations. Scroll down for video . Indestructable: The UCO Stormproof Matches (pictured) are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to it and will start burning again once it comes into contact with oxygen . Eric Moe, the product specialist at Industrial Revolution which owns Utility, Comfort and Originality (UCO), explained the process. The Stormproof matches are made by UCO which has been making outdoor accessories for the past 44 years. They include 25 matches in a completely waterproof case with and three strike pads. The matches cost £5.47 ($7.99) from UCO's website and are available from the UK distributor Dalesman International. He said: 'The match sticks are dipped into our coating, which keeps smouldering even underwater, then reignites once exposed to oxygen. 'Essentially, you aren't burning the match stick, but burning the coating on the stick. 'We have drenched them in buckets, buried them in mud, and blown them with a compressed air hose. 'In all cases the flame keeps burning. The matches will still ignite if they get wet, and they are quite impact resistant.' Even when buried in sand (left), the matches can burn again once they are taken out and exposed to oxygen (right). They can also keep smouldering even while underwater . Mr Moe, 31, from Milton, near Seattle, Washington, US, said when you are in unfamiliar terrain, having a source of fire is vital for survival. He said: 'Whether they're in a snowstorm, rainstorm or wind storm, the UCO Stormproof Matches will offer heat and light. 'The importance of being able to create a fire in inclement weather cannot be overstated. 'These matches are designed to ignite and keep burning in the worst conditions. 'Everything is more challenging when you are cold and wet, and it is crucial to have reliable equipment.' The makers explained that essentially, the match stick isn't burning, it is the coating on the stick that is alight: 'We have drenched them in buckets, buried them in mud, and blown them with a compressed air hose' Here the match is shown being dipped into water (left), and when it is take out (right) it is still able to burn . He explained that other devices that are used to light a fire are not always reliable. Mr Moe said: 'Lighters can fail at high altitudes, or if wet. Standard matches have little resistance to elements. Primitive techniques are excellent, but hard to execute in poor weather.

Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily, 14, were recognized by the front desk manager of the hotel they were staying at on Sunday, it was reported. They were found at 3am by NYPD officers and are in good health, officials said. Scroll down for video . Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were visiting Manhattan when they disappeared. They have now been found safe and well . Iona Costello's husband George, the co-owner of Costello Marine in Greenport, died from a heart attack in 2012 . Police questioned mother and daughter and now consider the case closed after releasing them. Iona called her mother at 3:30 a.m. on Monday morning to tell her she was ok. 'I'm thankful my daughter is safe. She's had a lot of pressure,' Iona's mother, Diana Malcolmson, told the New York Daily News. 'She just wanted to get away.' Iona claimed she had no idea friends and family members were worried about her sudden disappearance, her mother said. 'She hadn't listened to the news. She didn't know she was causing all this trouble,' Malcolmson said. Iona is in the midst of a nasty battle over the will of her husband, George Costello Sr., 63, who died of a heart attack as he was working on a Southampton barge on Dec. 28, 2012. News of Iona's reappearance comes after more details emerged about the colorful background of her late husband's family, who were in dispute with her over the contents of Mr Costello's will. It was revealed that the mother's stepson has a long criminal record and was jailed again just days after she disappeared, a report suggests. George Costello Jr is currently in jail in Florida on apparently unrelated charges and has been described by relatives as a 'mixed-up' kid.' British-born Mrs Costello and Emily were visiting Manhattan when they went missing on March 30 near their home in the the wealthy seaside village of Greenport. Their car was found in a parking garage on 42nd street in Manhattan, but the pair, who often went into the city for theater and art museums, left no other trace of their whereabouts. Iona's husband died in 2012 from a heart attack, and she is believed to have been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. The New York Daily News reported Iona's stepson Costello Jr, 45, was visiting Hamptons Bay, New York, at the time, and relatives said he has never got on with the family. He has a long history of drug arrests and is currently in Palm Beach Detention Center following an arrest for a 'domestic dispute' when he returned to Florida. His fiance, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the Daily News  it was a 'weird coincidence', but insists she was with him the whole time. Speaking from the prison, he told the newspaper he was visiting his Hampton Bay home at the time and flew home on April 1, two days after the pair went missing. George Jr, who has at least 10 arrests to his name, according to court records, says he didn't have a close relationship with Iona. He said the last time the pair spoke was at his father and her husband's funeral. Police reportedly told Iona's mother there is surveillance video of them leaving a parking garage laughing . Iona's brother-in-law John Costello (right), is facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. Costello's stepson, George Costello Jr (left), 45,  has a long history of drug arrests (mugshot from April) 'She's a hardworking lady who loves her horses and takes care of them really well. She's a good mother,' he told the Daily News. Iona's mother, Diana Malcomson, had also insisted George Jr wouldn't want to harm the pair, but said he was a 'mixed-up kid'. Her brother-in-law is also facing a criminal case. John Costello is  facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. They were reported missing by relatives of the 'quiet Irish family', who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork. Iona, who was her late husband George's third wife and inherited his entire estate along with her daughter, had been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. 'She can't sell anything. She can't do anything because everything is in court,' an unidentified relative told the New York Daily News. 'I don't know if she's having a nervous breakdown. I don't know if somebody has kidnapped them,' the unidentified family member said of the Costellos' long absence from their home and farm. Costello's adult children have argued that the will granting the estate to Iona was improperly executed, according to Novick Law Group. A Long Island court sided with the adult children last year, and Iona Costello is appealing. Amanda Hurwitz, one of George's daughters who now lives in Connecticut, refused to comment to Daily Mail Online on the report or her stepmother's disappearance. The widow's trip into New York was originally only supposed to last for several days. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not. The ninth grader had been scheduled to return to Ross School in East Hampton from her Spring Break this past Tuesday. The mother had told workers at her farm that she would be 'back on Tuesday' but did not return on March 31st, April 7th or April 14th. Workers at the horse farm said earlier it was strange for Mrs Costello not to be in contact with them about raising the animals. Southold police Chief of Police Martin Flatley told Daily Mail Online  his force did not suspect foul play. Relative Jane Costello said that calls to both Iona's and Emily's phones had gone straight to voicemail. Mrs Costello's family have lived in both the UK and the US, but she is British by birth. Her mother Diana and late father Euan, a stockbroker, lived in Stow in the Wold, Gloucestershire before setting sail for North America in 1958 aboard the Liberte cruise ship. Their plan was to live in Canada but they instead moved to Long Island. The couple returned to the UK at some point and records indicate that Mrs Costello was born in Marylebone in Central London, as was her brother Andrew. Mrs Costello's aunt Gwendoline Preston married Lord William Wynne-Jones, a renowned chemist and former vice-chancellor of Newcastle University.","Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily went missing on March 30 .

A father was asked to leave a Wetherspoon pub for a family breakfast with his wife and stepdaughter because he was wearing tracksuit bottoms. David Curry, 49, had travelled ten miles from  home to visit The Wallow in Blyth, Northumberland, for the first time with wife Vee, 45, and her daughter Kayleigh. But when the family arrived Mr Curry was told he could not stay in the pub because he was wearing a pair of £40 Adidas trousers. The pub chain has apologised to Mr Curry, from Ashington, but said a no-tracksuit policy had been in place at the bar since 2013. 'I go to my local Wetherspoon pub in Ashington all the time wearing track suit bottoms and we have never been denied entry,' said Mr Curry. 'We decided to go to this one instead for a change of scene. 'We had just walked in and were just about to go to the bar when a waiter said ""excuse me you have got to leave, you are wearing track suit bottoms"". 'I couldn't believe it. I just had to laugh and walk away.' Instead, the family travelled back to Ashington and went to a nearby pub for Sunday lunch. Self-employed builder Mr Curry said he often wears sportswear as part of a health regime that saw him shed 17 stone through exercise and giving up alcohol. He had been drinking 25 pints a day and ballooned to 28 stone, but changed his ways and started running up to 20 miles a day after being told he would die if he did not lose weight. Teaching assistant Mrs Curry said the pub chain has lost money by turning the family away at the door. 'I said you are joking! We had just come for our breakfast.

331,23276e51baad3d935ed5fd3c2c0e24d84ee3e046,"ALL DAY LONG . By Joanna Biggs . (Serpent’s Tail £14.99) Famously and memorably, the poet Philip Larkin asked: 'Why should I let the toad work / Squat on my life?' He longed to be '... courageous enough / To shout Stuff your pension! - but knew he never would. Coffee morning: Britain at work . The tyranny of the nine-to-five is about money (of course), but also about moral worth: we work because we know we should 'pull our weight' in society's tug-of-war. On any morning, in any town or city all over the world, people stream into their places of work, some driven by a sense of vocation, some by resigned boredom, some by greed, some by need. Surely it is work, not love, which makes the world go round? Joanna Biggs offers an excellent contribution to our knowledge of the world of work in all its variety - not through tedious sociological analysis (thank goodness), but through the stories of real people she has interviewed all over the country. Reading this book reminds me how times have changed dramatically since my generation left school or college in the Sixties with no worries about finding a job. We were lucky. Joanna Biggs makes it bleakly clear that for many people today, 'the idea that good work brings a good life no longer holds'. Biggs divides her workers in interesting categories, yoking disparate occupations in terms of their overall function. So the 'Making' chapter gives us a potter, a shoemaker and (yes) a robot, which introduces us to its maintenance engineers. 'Serving' includes a sex worker, two baristas, a call centre adviser and a political special adviser. Those 'Repairing' are a rabbi, an Army major and a nurse, while those 'Leading' are a company director, a stay-at-home mum (inspired, that one) and a hereditary lord. Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me' The scope of the book is broad. We meet those who are selling, entertaining, thinking, caring - as well as a curious clutch of people Biggs lumps together under 'Starting': a goldsmith's apprentice (one of my favourites), a rebellious intern, an entrepreneur specialising in 'start-up' technologies, an unemployed graduate. There's also a 56-year-old man on Mandatory Work Activity, usually known as 'workfare' - the Government initiative designed for those on Jobseeker's Allowance, to help them 'gain a better understanding of the discipline and focus required for work... while at the same time making a contribution to the community'. Joanna Biggs clearly does not think very much of 'workfare': in fact, it's clear she despises the scheme. Here, although of course anyone can see that the system is not perfect, I wish she hadn't editorialised so overtly. I really wanted to hear more about what John thought of his life. A book which aims to give the reader much-needed insight into other people's lives (and it certainly does that) seems to me to be spoilt by degenerating into a student newspaper leader: 'A citizen's income set at the right level - £320 a week is the current estimate - would kill off the sort of unproductive and low-paid jobs that have proliferated since 2008 in the UK.' At that point the author does not speculate what disastrous effects such indiscriminate largesse could have on the economy, with inevitable repercussions for the very men and women she has met. ALL DAY LONG By Joanna Biggs . In the Seventies I was a huge admirer of the work of America's Studs Terkel and England's Tony Parker, both oral historians who aimed to give insight into the lives of those with no voice, by using recorded interviews, carefully transcribed, with no questions included and no comment or judgment. It was a magnificent technique which catapulted the reader movingly (and sometimes shockingly) into the hearts and minds of prisoners, drifters, miners, people on a housing estate, and so on. You felt you got to know them without the author-interviewer standing in the way - although, of course, all interviews have to be edited. Joanna Biggs invokes Terkel: 'I've often wondered what (he) would think of how we think about work now.' Well, I reckon the great man would continue to record what he heard, without surprise, and without trying to fit life stories into a pre-conceived mould. In contrast, Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me: it felt as if work was becoming more insecure on one hand, and the work ethic increasingly revered on the other.' At the end, she lays her cards on the table, confessing that as she listened to people's stories, 'I most often wished for the way we work as a society to be organised more fairly and hoped for more resistance to the way it's organised now.' That's the trouble with the workers, you see. They've always been unpredictable individuals who may like or dislike their jobs but just get on with life, turning their backs on revolution.","Joanna Biggs tells the stories of real people she has interviewedin the UK .

The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday. It said it will still show the Oscar-nominated movie but with an educational forum follow-up to allow students to discuss the film. Bradley Cooper in his Oscar Nominated role as Chris Kyle, the most deadly sniper in US military history . The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (pictured) in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday . The film was postponed because senior management at the college did not want to create animosity or tension among its students. However they appear to have done just the opposite. Following complaints from the RPI’s Muslim Students’ Association a number of students have said the postponement was an act of censorship and an attack on free speech, Fox News reported. While the film grossed a total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis . A statement from the university explained the aim of the screening, coupled with the now scheduled educational forum, was to allow students in the campus community to ‘participate in an intellectual discourse about the film and current world events’. American Sniper, a film by Clint Eastwood about US Navy Seal sharp-shooter Chris Kyle the most deadly sniper in US history, has courted controversy since it was first shown in the US in November. While the film grossed an international total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis. It was also accused of stoking racial hatred after screenings of the film led to a rise in threats against Americans of Middle Eastern origin and even some attacks on Muslims outside movie theaters. Earlier this month the University of Michigan flip-flopped over whether or not it would show the film on its campus. The college pulled a screening over student complaints but quickly did an about-face after news of the cancellation sparked a firestorm on campus. The school released statement saying the decision to cancel had not been consistent with the high value it placed on freedom of expression. Navy Seal and Iraq war veteran Chris Kyle, depicted in the film, was killed at a shooting range in Texas . The school's vice president for student life, E. Royster Harper, acknowledged that it was ‘a mistake’ to call off the screening. ‘The movie will be shown at the originally scheduled time and location,’ Harper’s statement read. ‘We recognize, however, that some students are uncomfortable with the content of the movie, and appreciate that concern.’ An Alternative screening of the Paddington Bear movie was offered to those students who did not want to watch the American Sniper.

The 28-year-old flame-haired beauty recently spent a stint on the stage, starring in a West End production of David Mamet’s Speed The Plow - for which she received lukewarm reviews - and seems intent on remaining in the UK for the foreseeable future. ‘[London] feels like home, I miss it every time I have to leave for work and can’t wait to get back,’ Lindsay told Homme Style Magazine while posing for a stunning and seductive shoot for the publication. ‘I go back to NYC and LA for family and work.’ Scroll down for video .

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same ""situations"" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'","Lindsay, 28, moved to the UK last spring before making her London stage debut .

'Our target is to get through this round and reach the semi-finals, and if we qualify 1-0 or 1-1 (on aggregate), that's all the same to me,' said Allegri, whose side are at home in the quarter-final first leg on Tuesday. 'It could be a boring game, the important thing is not to concede a goal at home.' Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri strolls in to his pre-match press conference on Monday . The Juventus squad look relaxed as they are put through their paces in sunny Turin . Allegri warned that Monaco, who have conceded only four goals in eight games on their way to the quarter-finals, would be a completely different proposition to Borussia Dortmund, who Juventus beat 5-1 on aggregate in the last 16. 'The tie against Monaco is much more complicated than the one against Dortmund,' he said. 'They are two very different teams, the French side concede few goals and it's always more complicated to play against a team that doesn't go forward very often.

Arturo Vidal (left) and Fernando Llorente will both be hoping to start in the Champions League quarter-final . 'It's tempting to go forward ourselves and there is the risk of leaving spaces for them. We need patience, humility and intelligence, and to realise that we are not going to settle qualification in Turin. 'I think they (Monaco) have richly deserved to get to the quarter finals,' added Allegri. 'They conceded one goal in six games during the group stage, eliminating Benfica and Zenit St Petersburg. In Ligue 1, they have the best defence with 22 goals conceded (in 32 games). These figures do not come by chance.' Experienced defender Giorgio Chiellini smiles as he talks to the media on Monday afternoon . Allegri said that playmaker Andrea Pirlo had been included in the squad after recovering from a calf muscle injury, and he now had to decide whether the 35-year-old could be plunged into the tie after a seven-week lay-off. 'Pirlo hasn't played for more than 40 days, I'll decide after the last training session,' he said.","Juventus take on Monaco in Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday .

Sturridge will again be absent for Tuesday night's trip to Hull and while Rodgers will not take the drastic step of calling time on his campaign, he remains unsure whether the England international will play again this season. The 25-year-old missed five months with calf and thigh issues and he is now battling to overcome a hip problem that was sustained in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on March 22. Daniel Sturridge may not play again this season because of a series of calf and thigh injuries . Sturridge will miss Liverpool's trip to face Hull City on Tuesday night because of injury problems . Rodgers concedes it has been a difficult year for Sturridge but maintains Liverpool's medical department will continue to nurse him back to full fitness; the manager is also determined to bring in players to ease the burden on him next season. 'It had been difficult for Daniel,' said Rodgers. 'He wants to work and play. We are just going to have to monitor it. He is a good lad and when he had been fit, he has been brilliant for us. 'He is not available, we will do what is in the best interest of him. He is going to be here for the next number of years. 'There are always names associated. It is certainly something that we need to address. Daniel is top class but we need to give him help. 'You are nearly talking about a 100 per cent deficit. We have had 14 clean sheets. That side of the game has been addressed but we need to improve the critical area.'

337,353782941658f1ef7042ae65e0cd1057287065eb,"Brian Williams started embellishing his stories because he felt insecure following in Tom Brokaw's very large footsteps at NBC, according to a new report. The network handed Williams a six-month suspension in February after he acknowledged he had lied about being on board a helicopter that came under fire while reporting from Iraq in 2003. But according to a report in Vanity Fair, Williams started exaggerating his stories because he felt insecure about Brokaw, whom he succeeded at Nightly News in 2004. 'I always felt he needed to jack up his stories because he was trying so hard to overcome his insecurities,' one executive told the publication. Clash: Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams are pictured in New York in 2004 - the year Williams took over Brokaw's role on the Nightly News. A new report has claimed Williams always felt insecure following him . 'And he had to follow Tom, which brought its own set of insecurities. He likes to sort of tell these grandiose tales... I just saw it as one of the quirks of his personality.' But according to former correspondents who spoke to Vanity Fair, Brokaw wasn't so accepting of the 'quirks'. The stories left him 'incensed', the publication reported. On one occasion, Williams implied they had both been in Berlin together on the day the wall fell in 1989 - but he actually joined the veteran newscaster there the following day. On hearing the tale, Brokaw went into 'spasms of anger', one former exec told Vanity Fair. 'Tom treated that anchor chair as a public trust,' a former employee said. 'He really was our Walter Cronkite.' Others said that the two men had a troubled relationship after Williams took over the role because even though Brokaw pushed for him to get the job, Williams never 'embraced' him. 'I don't know why,' a source said. '[Williams] knows the rank and file will never love him like they did Tom, so he never tries. That's the reason there's not a lot of support for Brian over there.' Exaggerations: During a report in February, pictured, Williams recounted a tale of how he had been on a Chinook that came under fire while in Iraq in 2003 - but he had actually been in a separate aircraft . It also meant that when Williams found himself in hot water over his claim he had been in a downed Chinook - when he had actually been in a separate aircraft - Brokaw didn't have his back. A friend told the publication that while Brokaw - who was 'livid' about the scandal - didn't call for Williams to be punished, he 'didn't try to save him either.' Following the suspension, Williams reportedly declared to a friend: 'Chalk one up for Brokaw.' Not impressed: Brokaw, pictured in February, came 'incensed' when he heard Williams' exaggerations . The article also claimed that when he was called out for lying in his reports and conversations following the 2003 helicopter incident, Williams couldn't bring himself to admit he had made it up - and instead, he suggested he might have a brain tumor. '(He said,) 'Did something happen to (my) head? Maybe I had a brain tumor, or something in my head',' a source said. 'He just didn't know. We just didn't know. We had no clear sense what had happened. We got the best (apology) we could get.' When it came to uncovering the truth behind what actually happened in the 2003 helicopter incident, NBC quickly learned Williams himself would be of no help. 'He was having a tough enough time coming to grips with the idea that he had gotten it wrong in the first place, slash misrepresented it, slash lied,' one insider said. Others suggested that the problem with Williams' work was because the newscaster, who had never been a war or foreign correspondent before taking over at Nightly News, had no interest in reporting on war stories or 'heavy' news and lacked the experience of his predecessors. His appearance on late-night talk shows and comedy series, such as 30 Rock, suggested that instead of getting into gritty news, he actually wanted his own talk show, Vanity Fair suggested. While some NBC employees say this diversity was admirable and something his predecessors had never mastered, others say it did not go down well with the network. 'He didn't want to leave New York,' one source said. 'Getting him to war zones was real tough... but when he did go, he came back with these great stories that kind of put himself at the center of things.' In February, Williams was forced to admit that he wasn't aboard the helicopter that was hit and forced down by enemy fire in Iraq in 2003  - a story he had often repeated over the past 12 years. 'Overwhelmed': Sources told Vanity Fair that Williams, pictured in Iraq, did not want to report on 'hard' news and didn't enjoy politics or war stories, and lacked the experience of his predecessors . Lies: During a report in 2003, he reported how a Chinook, pictured, had been grounded but he later claimed he had been aboard the aircraft that was shot down. In fact, he was on one about 30 minutes behind . It came after he claimed on the Nightly News in January that his aircraft had been hit, causing outrage from the soldiers who had actually been involved. Crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire had told Stars and Stripes that the NBC anchor was nowhere near the aircraft or two other Chinooks that had been flying in formation when they took fire. According to the crew members, Williams arrived about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing. Even though Williams learned about the uproar over his false story on Facebook, he failed to bring it up with NBC execs when he met with them the next day, suggesting deeper flaws within the network and its relationship with staff, former employees told Vanity Fair. Days after the false report, he acknowledged the lie as he spoke to a reporter. 'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.' While Williams initially believed he'd be back to work within days, he was ultimately suspended for six months, and he accepted that he had to step back, sources said. NBC Nightly News is now being anchored by Lester Holt and it is unclear if Williams will return. Questions: A number of Williams' seemingly outlandish claims also came under scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. But in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams said he saved two puppies. In the same Esquire interview, Williams also revealed he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years, Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Earlier this year, he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' He was later suspended over the incident. Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Williams was suspended  from NBC in February after it emerged he'd lied about being in a helicopter that was shot down in Iraq in 2003 .

340,3d949acfd29875e1ec4059ba371b2bcc14e5a81e,"A 33-year-old woman on trial for having sex with a male inmate at Washington County Jail six times in four months while working as a services technician is hoping to use an insanity defense, claiming she was 'vulnerable, passive and gullible' and suffers from mental illness. Brett Robinson is facing 12 charges related to sexual misconduct and official misconduct after allegedly letting the inmate out of his cell multiple times and engaging in sex acts  between March and July last year. The case follows that of her colleague Lisa Curry, 39, who last month was sentenced to over four years prison for repeatedly having sex with a 25-year-old gang member and convicted rapist. Robinson, who worked in a maximum security control room known as 'the bubble', struck up a relationship with the inmate - who has not been named -  in a nearby cell. The two would talk using an intercom when Robinson's manager left the room. 'Gullible': Brett Robinson, 32, is facing 12 charges after allegedly letting the inmate out of his cell at Washington County Jail and engaging in sex acts between March and July last year . Charged: Robinson allegedly brought the male inmate into the control where she worked at Washing County Jail and had sex with him on his birthday under a blanket . According to a psychologist's report obtained by Oregon Live, Robinson felt flattered by the compliments she got from the inmate and started to 'open up to him' early last year. Then, in March, the inmate asked for a kiss on his birthday. When her manager went to lunch, Robinson released the inmate from his cell and brought him into the bubble. She thought it strange that he brought a blanket with him from the cell, the report said. 'He kissed me so passionately, I was taken aback. 'I asked about the blanket. 'He said ''I was hoping we could go farther''. 'Then he was saying ''we don't have time to discuss this'', so I had sex with him.' They continued having sexual encounters, the report said, and Robinson wrote the inmate a love letter that began with 'Hi Baby'. The letter said: 'I am hoping this letter will better convey the love I feel deep inside for you. ... You are a constant presence in my thoughts, fantasies and dreams, and I feel this pervasive emptiness without you by my side. It makes it hard to go about my normal daily activities when all I do is miss you. You are my everything, Baby – I could not envision my life without you in it.' New protocol: In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again . On trial: Brett Robinson, 33, faces charges of first-degree custodial sexual misconduct and first-degree official misconduct . However the relationship began to sour when Robinson started hearing about the abusive conduct of the inmate elsewhere in the prison. He had passed a sexually explicit note to a nurse and also pushed a female prisoner against a wall and kissed her. The psychologist noted that Robinson was delusional about the man. The report also said she had struggled with depression and anxiety since childhood. 'There is evidence that these delusions developed in this generally vulnerable, passive and gullible woman as part of a Major Depressive and Anxiety episode,' the doctor wrote. Robinson was caught when the inmate brought up their relationship to a prison employee during an investigation about Jill Curry. The prosecution is fighting against Robinson using the insanity defense. In March Curry was sentenced to four years and two months prison. That case was very similar to the allegations against Robinson. Curry was also a services technician and was convicted of letting gang member Jang-Li Delgado Galban, 25,  who was housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, out of his cell and have sex with him in a supply closet. Ex-Washington County Jail staffer Jill Curry, 39, cries in court last month as she was sentenced to more than four years in prison for repeatedly having sex with an inmate in a supply closet . Curry, who is married to a sheriff's deputy, pleaded guilty last month to custodial sexual misconduct and other charges stemming from her contact with Delgado Galban. Authorities said the sexual misconduct occurred while a deputy was at lunch, when Curry, a civilian jail services technician, was alone in the unit's control room, reports The Oregonian. Curry pushed a button to unlock the inmate's cell and the pair would then meet in the supply closet to have sexual relations. This occurred 13 times, said prosecutor Jeff Lesowski. A probation officer who conducted a pre-sentencing investigation had recommended a prison sentence of less than two years, which the defense asked the judge to impose. Judge Bailey went above the state's recommendation when sentencing Curry. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office first started their investigation into Curry's actions on July 8, 2014, when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician. Curry had claimed that Jang-Li Delgado Galban, a 25-year-old gang member housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, had seduced her . Curry was placed on administrative leave that day, pending a criminal investigation. She had been working in the sheriff's office since October 2004, serving different parts of the jail including booking, inmate units and the control center. An article published in The Oregonian in 2010 said that in December 2009, Delgado-Galban, then 20 years old, allegedly broke into a woman's apartment in Hillsboro and raped her. The suspect later agreed to a plea deal, as part of which he admitted to one count of burglary with the intent to commit rape in exchange for having the rape charges dropped. In December 2010, Delgado-Galban was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison, and ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release. But according to sheriff's officials, he failed to meet the conditions of the plea agreement, which landed him behind bars in the Washington County Jail where he encountered Curry. In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again.","Brett Robinson, 33, facing 12 charges after allegedly letting an inmate out of his cell and engaging in sex acts between March and July last year .

341,e0a5406bd964ee77d6af8079972138d3972179bb,"Tony Pulis returned to Selhurst Park for the first time since he left Crystal Palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his West Bromwich Albion side to the edge of safety. Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palace’s fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving. A few boos broke the surface, but they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season, during his 10-month tenure, when he won the Premier League LMA Manager of the Year award. West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side with a fine long ranged effort . Before two minutes on the clock, James Morrison (right) headed West Brom ahead following a corner from team-mate Chris Brunt .

It has got unbelievable potential and I mean that. The supporters are wonderful and they have a good manager. They can push on – if Alan is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward this club could be a good club.’ Yannick Bolasie even made the effort to go over and shake Pulis’ hand as he strolled down the touchline. Yet the south London locals would not have been expecting what came within two minutes of kick off when West Brom took the lead. Chris Bunt swung in a corner from the left and James Morrison managed to lose Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon and nod in, completely free, from five yards out. Some of Puncheon’s team-mates looked around in disbelief that the West Brom man was afforded so much space in the box. ‘That was a weakness in our set up that Tony exploited,’ Pardew admitted. ‘It was well worked. Their guy took Puncheon to the edge of the box where he is not comfortable marking. ‘We knew Tony would know the players well, know the strengths and weaknesses, I tried to throw a few ideas in on the pitch. They didn’t come off. Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie greets former Eagles boss Tony Pulis (right) before kick-off at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon .

People know Tony does an honest job, he plays the game his way and we respect that.’ Despite that early set back, however, Crystal Palace started to play the eye-catching football that has made Pardew so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge. And it was all coming through their main man, Bolasie, on the left. In the 24th minute he weaved into the box, played a one-two then poked an effort towards the near post which West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill did well to save with his feet. Three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that Myhill clawed out. Then, just after the half-hour, a ball came in from the opposite flank from Joel Ward, was headed on by Glenn Murray and Bolasie executed a sublime bicycle kick, only to be denied by Myhill once again. If Pulis, dressed in his usual full tracksuit, trainers and cap on the touchline, provided this Crystal Palace team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight, Pardew, resplendent in suit and tie, has given them the suave and flair to delight. In this instance, Pulis’ resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes. The ball came out from a West Brom corner and Gardner took a touch before, 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, he buried a right-foot strike over Julian Speroni into the left of goal. It is almost mission accomplished for Pulis at West Brom as they moved to 36 points and put a healthy gap between themselves and the bottom three.

Alice Barker snapped her fingers and sang along as videos of her routines as a chorus line dancer during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance played on the screen. Barker had danced at legendary clubs like the Apollo, Cotton Club and Zanzibar Club, and had appeared in movies commercials and television shows. This is the moment 102-year-old Alice Barker, who used to dance with the likes of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, got to see herself shimmy and shake on film for the first time . Barker (pictured far right in the video) snapped her fingers and sang along as videos of her routines as a chorus line dancer during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance played on the screen . But she had never gotten the chance to watch herself dance. She didn't even have any photographs or memorabilia to remember her years on stage. It was David Shuff, who met Barker years ago when he brought his therapy dog to her retirement home, that finally reunited the one-time famous dancer with her videos. After a long and unsuccessful first search, Shuff connected with Mark Cantor, a collector of short musical films called 'soundies' who runs the online archive Jazz on Film. It was then Shuff and Cantor discovered that Barker's videos were filed under 'Baker', a misspelling of her name - which was why no one had been able to find them before, according to Mashable. They located three of Barker's soundies, giving her the chance to finally watch her days in the chorus line, where she was almost always in the front row. 'Don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing,' Barker sang along as she watched one of her routines. When Shuff asked her how many years she danced, Barker replied 'that's all I ever did, that was it!' She said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again'.

Barker found herself needing to dance and move to  music at a young age. She told Shuff a story about when she was a child and her mother was preparing her for a bath. Her mother had gone to the house to retrieve something when a young Barker heard a band play nearby. 'When she came back I was gone,' said Barker. 'I was down there naked just going, dancing.' 'And then, if the band would stop playing, I'd look at them and ""come on, let's get it going, let's get it going here.""' Barker said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again' But the most special part for Barker was getting to watch herself dance again. 'I used to often say to myself, I am being paid to do something that I enjoy doing and I would do it for free,' she said . Shuff shared Barker's story on Reddit, where he wrote that the videos were now in her possession and that they are often played in her retirement center's communal room, noting that she's a 'rock star these days'.

The 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego upheld a lower court ruling that tossed out a family's lawsuit trying to block the Encinitas Union School District from teaching yoga as an alternative to traditional gym classes. The lawsuit brought by Stephen and Jennifer Sedlock and their two children claimed the school district's yoga classes promoted Hinduism and inhibited Christianity. Scroll down for video . Students hold their positions during a yoga class at Capri Elementary School in Encinitas, California, in 2012 . A California appeals court ruled yoga classes taught at Capri do not violate students' right to religious freedom . The court upheld the previous ruling in a 3-0 opinion. The district court wrote: 'While the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts, yoga classes as taught in the district are, as the trial court determined, ""devoid of any religious, mystical, or spiritual trappings."" 'We conclude that the program is secular in purpose, does not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion and does not excessively entangle the school district in religion. 'The district's yoga program does not violate our state constitution.' The First Amendment bans school-sponsored religious promotion and prayer. Yoga instructor Kristen McCloskey (right) leads third graders at Olivenhain Pioneer Elementary School in 2012 . The Sedlocks were disappointed with the ruling and are considering their options. Attorney Dean Broyles said: 'No other court in the past 50 years has allowed public school officials to lead children in formal religious rituals like the Hindu liturgy of praying to, bowing to, and worshipping the sun god.' A school distort lawyer said there were no rituals occurring in the classroom and no one was worshipping the sun or leading Hindu rites. The district said the practice is taught in a secular way to promote strength, flexibility and balance. Yoga is now taught at schools across the country, but the district is believed to be the first with full-time yoga teachers at all schools. A three-year grant from the K.P. Jois Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes Ashtanga yoga, provides twice-weekly, 30-minute classes to the district's 5,600 students.

Mr Doggett said violence at matches has increased recently as older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their 'gangs' Writing in his club's latest programme, Mr Doggett said: 'Unfortunately football clubs still attract an undesirable element of society that appear determined to ruin the enjoyment of real supporters of football clubs. 'Our promotion to the Football League appears to have encouraged our ""risk"" from the 1980s to come out of retirement. 'Many of them are grandparents trying to encourage the next generation to join their ""gangs"". 'It sounds pathetic but unfortunately it is reality. We are working closely with police. 'Hopefully the reality of the potential consequences will dissuade some of our younger supporters from becoming involved with these undesirables. 'Our football club is too important to so many to allow a few to ruin our great sport.' Peter Woor, a Cambridge United fan, said he had noticed that the hooliganism of the 1970s and 1980s still lingers in games against local rivals such as Southend United and Luton Town. He said: 'There's a tension and you feel threatened so I don't go to those places anymore. It's not worth it. 'Most places are fine though, but you still tend to go to away games and keep your colours hidden. 'I remember the 1970s and 1980s and it was horrendous and of course it's nothing like that but it's still a problem. 'These people must have something missing in their lives to want to do this.

Cambridgeshire Police said the force has also seen an increase in the 'severity and volume' of football-related disorder this season. Inspector Steve Kerridge said: 'We have seen an increase in football-related violence and disorder amongst a very small minority of people, both in Cambridge and other locations when the club has travelled. 'The tragic events recently leading to a serious injury in Southend have been reported widely and sicken us all. Mr Doggett said Cambridge United had noticed an increase in violence since the club was promoted to League Two last year.

'The club is working hard with us to ensure that those who use football as a vehicle for violence and disorder have no place in the terraces or association with Cambridge United.'

He added: 'The increase of risk activity both in severity and volume this season means regular consideration of this level of intervention is once again - and sadly - justified and necessary.'

A goal down at the time, Inverness fought back and eventually emerged victorious following a pulsating period of extra-time and the Celtic players could do little to hide their fury after the match. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a shot at goal during the Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness . Griffiths heads the ball, which is deflected clearly off the hand of Inverness' Josh Meekings (left) on Sunday . Despite numerous appeals, no penalty or red card was given for Meekings' handball and Inverness won . 'We have a lot of disappointed lads inside that dressing room — we've been robbed,' said Griffiths who, more than an hour after the final whistle, was still struggling to contain his own disbelief and anger. 'It was very disappointing. We had a chance to go and make history. We didn't get the result in the end.' Celtic were a Virgil van Dijk goal to the good at the time of the Meekings incident but the game was then turned on its head in the second half as Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon was sent off for a foul on Marley Watkins. Greg Tansey equalised with the resultant spot-kick and suddenly John Hughes' men were in ascendancy. With the teams level at full-time, Edward Ofere and John Guidetti swapped goals in extra-time before David Raven grabbed a 117th-minute winner — leaving the Highlanders jubilant and their opponents distraught. Parkhead manager Ronny Deila had insisted he need not say anything about the penalty incident. Scott Brown, meanwhile, stalked past with a face like thunder, lightning and Force 10 hurricane all rolled into one angry swirling mass, damned near taking the door off its hinges as he made a dramatic exit from the depths of the national stadium. 'I have asked the centre-half in the second half if it has hit his hand or his face - and he said it hit his hand 100 per cent, so in my book that's a penalty and a red card,' continued Griffiths. 'We have probably the best penalty taker in the league in Kris Commons, who I am sure would go and tuck it away to put us 2-0 up.

I asked the ref why he didn't give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him in the face. I don't know what angle he is looking from because everyone else could see it was a penalty. 'He said the referee behind the goal said it hit him in the face and there is nothing I can do about that now. It is a game-changing decision. 'When you have officials behind the goals, they need to be doing their job. If he thinks that's him in on the face ...? 'I don't really want to say too much about the officials because I'll end up in trouble. But it's a massive, massive decision and it's cost us the game. 'Everybody was so content that we were going to win the league, we already have a trophy (the League Cup) in the bag. Everyone was saying the Scottish Cup was practically a given. But we knew we had to come here and do a job - and it's just unlucky that we never managed to get it done.' Griffiths attempts an acrobatic shot at goal during the Scottish Cup semi-final on Sunday against Inverness . As much as Griffiths was nursing a personal grievance over being denied yet another Hampden semi-final goal, the former Hibs star felt for manager Deila, a man who has been so open about his desire to win a Treble – and his belief in this team's ability to do so. Celtic had made no bones about their determination to succeed where so many had failed, backing themselves to have the skill and strength to get the job done, whatever obstacles they might have to overcome. 'I think the gaffer is the most disappointed person out of everyone,' said the Griffiths. 'He'd only have been the third Celtic manager to have won a Treble. 'He would have made history and as players we would have become legends. But it' s difficult to do that. I said it during the week that when you are that close to winning a Treble, the games get harder. Inverness stood in our way and did a job. 'Now we have to go again and pick ourselves up for the rest of the season. We have a massive game at Dens Park on Wednesday. Dundee will be up for it, we've just played 120 minutes in a semi-final. We have three days and then we have to play Dundee at a difficult venue. But we need three points. 'This will fire us up. We aren't far away from clinching the league now. We have two hard games in the next week at Dens and Tannadice. If we go there and pick up three points from each, we will be in a real good position.' From Treble to Double, just like that. Celtic will be weary on Wednesday, certainly. But Dundee should certainly beware some kind of angry backlash. And the Dens Park ground staff may want to reinforce some of the doors. Just in case Brown takes the storm with him.

Perry Clawson, a former Army colonel, was pictured Friday sitting outside the University of Florida's Zeta Beta Tau frat house in Gainesville, waving a Stars and Stripes of his own. Clawson, who said the members had 'p*****d off' servicemen across the country with their actions, pitched up outside the building, proudly displayed the flag which accompanied him on two tours of duty to Iraq. Shall not be moved: Perry Clawson, a retired Army colonel, pitched up outside the Zeta Beta Tau frat house in protest of their alleged treatment of wounded veterans . Disrespected: Nicholas Connole, pictured, said that braying students spat on him and his service dog as he tried to enjoy a vacation with his wife . Service: Connole is picutred above during on of his tours of duty in the Middle East . 'Disgusting': Linda Cope, who founded the retreat to honor her wounded son, said she saw frat members urinating on the U.S. flag . He was one of many veterans to respond to unedifying allegations that Zeta Beta Tau members had abused soldiers attending the Warrior Beach vacation retreat in Panama City Beach, the Gainesville Sun reported. The charity event provides vacations for maimed soldiers, their carers and families - but ran afoul of braying frat boys holding an event of their own earlier this month. One veteran, wounded Nicholas Connole, said frat members spat on him and his service dog from their balconies. He told local TV station WJHG: 'They actually spat on me and my service dog as well, and that's just so disrespectful and it hurts.' Haley Riley, whose husband is another injured veteran, said students hurled beer bottles at attendees. Linda Cope, who founded the retreat after her son lost both his legs in an IED explosion, said that rowdy students even went so far as to urinated on the American flag. Suspension: The Zeta Beta Tau chapter at the University of FLorida has been suspended, and three of its members expelled. There is nothing to suggest anybody in the photograph above was involved . Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was suspended in the wake of the allegations, which university authorities are investigating. They have charged the organization with 'causing physical or other harm, obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft and property damage'. The fraternity has expelled three members and is also holding its own investigation. The expelled frat members have not been named. It has yet to determine what exactly took place, but said in a statement that 'there is no doubt that some our members engaged in unacceptable behavior.' While Panama City Beach police were called to deal with the frat members, they ultimately let the resort management handle them, and did not file any charges or write a police report. Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was already on probation after being found guilty of holding hazing rituals at the start of this academic year. It was already restricted to a limited events program - and will face even tougher penalties than usual if the university decides to take action. Another Zeta Beta Tau chapter, belonging to Emory University in Georgia, was also caught up in the allegations, but has denied that any of its students were involved.","Retired Col.

Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, . Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to . an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of . Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the . theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart . Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video . Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 . A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist . This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught . 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they . think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are . threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the . Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and . threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black. Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter . Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum . Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck . The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined . to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, . 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the . museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair . allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs . in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on . the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum . The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces . Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung . In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an Édouard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case . gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar . FBI investigators have long said they believed organized . crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed . a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked . if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court . testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the . stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police . uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most . recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of . illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon.

350,93a56eb66611037c19d47c2cfb759c38d7abf95a,"(CNN)It came a day early. Baltimore investigators handed their files on Freddie Gray's death over to prosecutors Thursday, but the public shouldn't expect much. It's largely a procedural step, and given the overtures from Baltimore officials, the state's attorney's decision on whether to file charges against the six officers involved in the arrest will not be immediate. No reports will be made public, police Commissioner Anthony Batts said, echoing an assertion he made last week that even after the prosecutors receive the files, the task force assigned to Gray's death will continue investigating. ""That is just us sitting down, providing all the data we have. We will continue to follow the evidence wherever it goes,"" Batts said. The Gray family's legal team had no expectations otherwise. ""I hate to say this, but I think if people are waiting for answers or charges to come,"" attorney Mary Koch said this week, ""I don't think that's going to happen based on the way the process works, and I think that the government officials need to advise people of how the process honestly works and to lower their expectations about what's going to happen."" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake seemed reluctant to do so during a Thursday interview with CNN. Pressed several times on whether answers would be forthcoming, the mayor seemed to dance around the question. Handing over the report represents ""an inflection point,"" she said at first, before explaining that it also marks a ""continuation in a process toward justice."" She went on to reiterate a point officials have made several times, that releasing information hastily could jeopardize the probe and any possible prosecution. Asked again if it was fair for people to assume they would not get answers immediately, she said Baltimore officials had a ""duty to protect the justice process."" Prodded on whether the public should expect her or Batts to announce findings, she said she didn't want to ""seek justice for optics"" and explained she had spoken to schools, clergy and community leaders about what to expect. Finally, asked flat out if people should expect an end to the saga when the report was handed over, she replied: ""Well, it can't be the end. There's been no charges. There's been no trial. It cannot be the end."" The family understands the process and was warned at the outset to be patient, Koch said Thursday. ""We've told the family from the beginning that answers were not going to come quickly and that the investigation needed to be full and complete, ... and hopefully what will happen is the correct people are charged, those charged are prosecuted and that prosecution sticks,"" she said. Perhaps lost amid the chaos that has descended on Baltimore is that there is not one, but two investigations, seeking to determine how Gray suffered a fatal spine injury in police custody. The mayhem since Gray's April 19 death a week after his arrest -- the looting, vandalism, blazes, attacks on police and firefighters, marauding criminals stoking the havoc -- has overtaken, or at least outweighed, updates about the investigations. Newly appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday that the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the FBI ""will continue our careful and deliberate examination of the facts in the coming days and weeks."" Because of the Baltimore police's history, the Justice Department has been working with the force since October as part of a reform initiative that will assess ""policies, training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens."" Rawlings-Blake requested that the Justice Department take a look at the police department, The Baltimore Sun reported, saying her request came on the heels of the newspaper's report that the city had paid almost $6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011. Overwhelmingly, The Sun reported, the people involved in the incidents that sparked the lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges. Asked during her Thursday interview why no police officers have yet been charged in Gray's case -- given that if the case involved civilians instead of officers there would ostensibly be probable cause for arrests -- Rawlings-Blake, an attorney by trade, said the question amounted to speculation and cited her efforts to reform the Baltimore Police Department and repair the community's mistrust in police. ""Quite likely, but it could be the same situation, and at the end of the day, it's about this case and making sure we're getting this case right. It has nothing to do with speculation about any other cases out there. This family wants justice. They don't want us to sit here and speculate about what could've have happened if it was a private citizen that did it,"" she said. Rawlings-Blake and police officials have repeatedly promised answers and accountability. ""We welcome outside review,"" police spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk has said. ""We want to be open. We want to be transparent. We owe it to the city, and we owe it to the Gray family to find out exactly what happened."" According to police, officers encountered Gray on April 12 and he ""fled unprovoked."" Three officers gave chase, apprehended Gray and carried him -- screaming, his legs dangling listlessly -- to a police transport van. Once at the police station, officers requested an ambulance, which took Gray to the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center, where he died a week later. An autopsy report indicated Gray died of a spinal injury, but Batts has said that the medical examiner was still awaiting a toxicology report and a spinal expert's analysis before issuing his final report. So far, six officers involved in the arrest have been suspended with pay: Sgt. Alicia White, 30; Officer William Porter, 25; Officer Garrett Miller, 26; Officer Edward Nero, 29; Lt. Brian Rice, 41; and Officer Caesar Goodson, 45. Five of them have given statements to investigators, Batts said. Releasing the officers' names is standard procedure after an in-custody death and in no way implicates wrongdoing, Kowalczyk said. Though the investigation is not yet complete, Batts said last week there are at least two indications that officers involved in Gray's arrest did not follow protocol. ""We know he was not buckled in the transport wagon, as he should've been. No excuses for that, period,"" he said. ""We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times."" That Gray wasn't buckled has raised speculation that he was injured during what's known as a ""rough ride"" or ""nickel ride,"" in which officers place a handcuffed suspect in a police van and drive recklessly so as to toss the suspect around. Asked if Gray could have incurred his injuries via a rough ride or outside of the van, Batts said there is ""potential"" that both could be true. Baltimore police have established a task force of 30 investigators -- including members of the force investigation unit and homicide detectives -- to look into Gray's death, Batts said. They've conducted dozens of interviews, canvassed the region on foot seeking witnesses and procured video from closed-circuit television cameras. Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis, who is overseeing the task force as the head of the Investigations and Intelligence Bureau, said last week that the evidence suggested the transport van carrying Gray made three stops before delivering him to the police station. But on Thursday, he said a privately owned camera had captured evidence of a fourth stop. Rice and two other officers on bikes were the first to see Gray, Davis said last week. Two officers remained on their bikes and one gave chase on foot, pursuing Gray for about one-fifth of a mile, he said. ""That's where the apprehension of Freddie Gray occurred, and quite frankly, that's exactly where Freddie Gray should have received medical attention, and he did not,"" Davis said last week. The paddy wagon carrying Gray traveled about one block before stopping, and Gray was removed from the van and placed in leg irons, Davis said last week. On Thursday, Davis revealed that the van stopped again, about a mile from where police placed shackles on Gray. He did not elaborate on that stop. From there, according to the narrative Davis provided last week, the van then traveled about half a mile before stopping again ""to deal with Mr. Gray, and the facts of that interaction are under investigation,"" he said. It was at that stop, Batts added, that officers lifted Gray off the floor and placed him on a seat in the transport van. Gray requested a medic during that stop, he said. The van then traveled to another incident, about a mile away and just a few hundred feet from where Gray was first spotted and chased. There, a second prisoner was placed in the van, which headed back to the police department's Western District building, about a mile away, the deputy commissioner said. It was only then that an ambulance was called and Gray was taken to the hospital. ""It's complex,"" Davis said of the probe. ""It involves a minutiae of details. It requires our full talents, our full time, and we're going to get this right."" CNN's Chris Cuomo contributed to this report.","Prosecutors get investigative report a day early, but don't expect immediate word on charges .
Attorney general: We're continuing ""careful and deliberate examination of the facts""
Gray family was told ""answers were not going to come quickly,"" and that's fine, attorney says ."
351,475ed771e0c8382c1ce3025f1eb21afd484c3a72,"(CNN)Thousands of Syrian and Palestinian refugees trapped in the Yarmouk refugee camp have suffered what can only be described as untold indignities. But while the story is in itself tragic, it is the individual lives at the heart of the camp that make the imperative for humanitarian action so compelling. I encountered two such individuals on my mission to Damascus -- Jihad and Mohammad -- tiny, vulnerable infants who were taken from Yarmouk in recent days, a place that was described last week by the U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as ""the deepest circle of hell."" The fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children. Looking into those bright young faces, touching their pristine hands, the logic of our humanitarian mandate -- the mission to protect -- never felt stronger to me. Like the wider Syrian conflict, Yarmouk has a human face; the faces of young Mohammad and young Jihad. I want to introduce you to them in the hope that you, too, will understand why I am firmly convinced that turning away is not an option -- and why the international community must act in a concerted manner to respond to the many tragedies in Syria. Jihad Ya'qoub, the youngest Palestinian refugee to flee Yarmouk, was born on March 30. His mother, Said Fatima, never imagined bringing a child into this world could be so tough. ""I was hoping to drink milk and eat eggs during my pregnancy, but our financial situation did allow us to buy these expensive food items,"" she said. Said Fatima was living in a community where the average person survived on just 400 calories a day. Mohammad was born in Yarmouk on January 25 of this year. When ISIS -- Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- entered the camp and tensions heightened, his mother, Nadia, fled in search of safety. Her only thoughts were to save the life of her newborn son. Yet she has not lost hope in the possibility of a dignified future. She hopes that if and when life returns to normal, she will be able to live once more with her husband and son in the family home in Yarmouk. These tales of courage and human dignity are a lesson for us all. When I next brief the Security Council, as I did a few days ago, I will tell them about Jihad and Mohammad.  I will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside Yarmouk, other civilians who need help where they are. To do this, hostilities will have to subside. Pressure must be exerted on armed actors in Yarmouk to this end. Beyond that, those civilians wishing to temporarily leave must be allowed to do so safely. These things are all possible. But it takes the necessary political will -- nothing more, nothing less. Yarmouk must be a place where the politics of the possible begin to take hold. I believe they can. Because to abandon such belief would be to abandon Jihad, Mohammad and thousands of other civilians like them. And that is simply not an option.","Yarmouk is a refugee camp near Damascus in war-ravaged Syria .

353,8e2df8305bde3aab6be00deac30cfb1b59e6d383,"(CNN)Geography is, in part, destiny for Italy: The country will always be a bridge between Africa and Europe, as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean so starkly shows. A surge of refugees this year, usually transported by smugglers on overcrowded vessels, has sought to reach Europe via the Libyan coast.  A boatload of 900 migrants who embarked from Libya are now feared dead in the latest sinking. Over 10,000 were rescued off the coast of Italy in the last week alone. European leaders are scrambling to deal with this emergency. There is a backstory here worthy of our attention, and it has to do with Italy's colonial past. Many of the refugees involved in recent disasters come from some of Italy's former colonies in North and East Africa, namely Eritrea (occupied from 1890-1941) and Somalia (1908-1941). As migrants, Libyans are fewer in number, but Libya (1912-1941) plays a central role in the current crisis as the main departure point for Italy. Italy's empire never rivaled that of the British and the French in scope and longevity, but those who lived in its possessions were no less affected. Indeed, the migrants traversing the Mediterranean today form part of a century-long chain of migrations, expulsions, and exiles sparked by Italy's imperial ambition and commercial interests, the post-colonial anger of African leaders, and now mass economic desperation and political strife. Long after the formal end of Italian colonialism, these Eritreans, Somalis, and Libyans have inherited the histories of influence and exploitation that shaped their home countries. It also affects the treatment of Africans who settle in Italy. Libya is an example of the long reach of Italian imperialism. Libya was for a brief period an incorporated province of Italy, on the model of French Algeria, and Libyan families still feel the devastating effects of the fascist dictatorship's persecution of those who resisted Italian occupation. Over 100,000 Libyan men, women, and children were deported to concentration camps deep in the desert in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and much of the ruling class was exiled or executed. Col. Moammar Gadhafi, who ruled from 1969 to 2011, was born during the Italian occupation of his country, and his identity as a revolutionary was shaped by the example of resistance leaders such as Omar al-Mukhtar, who was hanged by the fascists in front of 20,000 of his people in 1931. In 1970, soon after he took power, Gadhafi struck back, expelling the remaining Italian community in Libya. Some of those people had grown up entirely in Libya. They arrived in Italy for the first time, at some of the same ports receiving migrants today. This political intervention did not spell the end of Italian-Libyan commercial dealings, which grew out of colonial-era relations that had made Libya Italy's biggest oil supplier. Since 2004, Italy and Libya have been directly connected by the Greenstream natural gas pipeline, which runs below the Mediterranean, on the same axis as many migrant boats. Commercial concerns, and the cozy relationship of then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Gadhafi, also lay behind a historic 2008 Friendship Treaty between Italy and Libya, which promised infrastructure and other aid to Libya worth the equivalent of $5 billion as compensation for the damages inflicted by Italy during the decades of colonial rule. Until his death in 2011, despite deals with Italy and the European Union to control departures from his borders, Gadhafi intermittently used European fears of mass arrivals of migrants from Libya as a political weapon. Given Europe's geography, this weapon was pointed particularly at Italy, Libya's former master, and the principal target of Gadhafi's post-colonial revenge politics. Few Italians learn about this colonial history and its legacies, even though episodes of racist violence against immigrants from former Italian colonies and elsewhere are on the rise. Upon her appointment in 2013 as minister of integration, Cécile Kyenge, an Italian of Congolese origin, faced ugly racist attacks from fellow Italian politicians, including a comment that she looked like an orangutan. This climate has encouraged those who wish to rehabilitate the ""heroes"" of fascist imperialism. In 2012, the town of Affile built a publicly-funded memorial to General Rodolfo Graziani, known as ""the butcher of Fezzan"" for his brutal repression of Libyan resisters in the 1920s -- and for the massacre of Ethiopian civilians he ordered in response to a 1937 attempt on his life. This colonial history and its long-term consequences can help us understand Italians' ambivalent reactions to the emergency on their southernmost shores. Italian rescuers and activists work tirelessly and selflessly, and yet migrants who remain in Italy are often subject to racist attacks. It is ironic that the name chosen for the sea rescue operation organized by the Italian Navy in 2013 was the slogan of the fascist's dictatorship's bid to control the Mediterranean: Mare Nostrum. The program rescued more than 160,000 migrants in one year before it was discontinued due to European Union budget restrictions. It seems to reflect the conflicted attitude of the Italian government to its past aggressions: an admirable and courageous initiative -- advanced under an imperialist banner. The Italian government deserves the full support of the European Union as it responds to the current humanitarian crisis. But it also needs to address the failure of civic education about its colonial past. At 40 years old, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is of a different generation than those who have sustained a politics of selective memory that is as dangerous in its own way for migrants as the boats now capsizing in the Mediterranean. Setting a new course on this issue is in Italy's interest, now more than ever.","Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Italy's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the Mediterranean .

Manuel Pellegrini's City were poor for all but the opening 15 minutes against Louis van Gaal's side at Old Trafford and Neville, speaking on Sky Sports, is certain big changes are afoot for the club. 'It's a crossroads for them now,' Neville said as City drifted four points behind their third-placed cross-city rivals who are now one point off Arsenal in second. Yaya Toure's defensive lapses are costing Manchester City, claims Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville . Niall Quinn and Graeme Souness joined the chorus of criticism of the under-fire Ivorian . 'There is definitely going to be change at Manchester City, whether it's players, the manager, people above. Certainly some players. 'There are some weeds in the garden and you've got to get them out of the changing room pretty quick. You cannot carry passengers.' Neville singled out Toure as an example of the 'weeds' at the Etihad in a scathing attack. 'He does that much for the team in an attacking sense you live with maybe the consequences of that defensively,' he said. 'But when the balance tips to a point when going forward isn't quite as effective as it once was, you've got to do something different because the defensive side is poor. Neville predicts changes at Manchester City and says the club need to get rid of 'weeds in the garden' 'If I was a player in that dressing room looking at him in central midfield thinking you're not chasing back, you're not running around, you're not sprinting for the ball. There might be a physical problem that he cannot do it, let alone if he doesn't want to do it. I think there's definitely going to be some changes.' Graeme Souness, also on Sky Sports, even suggested the 31-year-old's work when his side doesn't have the ball is a factor in their disappointing Champions League results in recent years. Neville accused Toure of a 'complete dereliction of (his) duty' when marking Marouane Fellaini and blamed his lack of tracking back for United's third goal from Juan Mata. City players' heads drop after conceding the fourth goal on Sunday their their cross-city rivals . 'He cannot play in a two in midfield against an opposition of any quality,' said Neville on Sky Sports. 'Against maybe one of the lesser teams at home you can put him in there and play with two up top, but against any team of quality you've got to shift him out of that position in the centre of midfield. 'There are too many examples, too much evidence when watching him where he cannot do his job, simple as that. As a central midfield player in the big matches he just cannot do it.' Souness said Toure's become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young celebrate after the winger's cross found the tall Belgian for 2-1 . 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why they've not done as well as they should have done in Europe.' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher pointed the finger at the City chiefs for allowing the team to get into their current state and said the fallen champions are 'gone'. The former Liverpool defender told talkSPORT: 'They’ve been a great team, but that team needs breaking up and changing. The criticism I have is for the people at the top, to have that much money and to allow yourself to get into a situation where you might need five or six players to go straight into the team. 'You look at the age of the team and it’s too old, so you need a lot of new blood. It’s going to take a lot of money. 'It’s gone for them now, physically, mentally, every part of the game. They’ve been a great team and we should applaud what they’ve achieved over the past three or four years, but it’s the end for this team now. It’s got to be broken up.' Niall Quinn, also on Sky Sports, said bluntly: 'Manchester City lost out today because he was all at sea and didn't do his defensive duties.' Toure also came in for criticism on Match of the Day 2 for his lack of leadership after he took the captain's armband at half-time. Trevor Sinclair said: 'He keeps on getting caught in no-mans land, he's not really at it, clipping the heels, and he's literally going through the motions. Trevor Sinclair and Phil Neville were both critical of City and Toure on Match of the Day 2 . 'Fellaini has completely outshone him today. He is outnumbered and I'm sure he's frustrated but again he's just going through the motions.' Picking out on particular aerial duel, which Toure lost, Sinclair said: 'This is nothing to do with ability, that's to do with desire and wanting to take one for the team.' Sinclair also felt Toure was at fault for Chris Smalling's goal, United's fourth. 'He's got to organise this better,' he said. 'If you're captain of the team you've got to keep that high line, dictate and tell the lads to get in positions and win the ball. They were queuing up on the far stick.' Phil Neville said: 'The minute they concede a goal and their backs are against the wall, they crumble. They lost their shape, they lost their discipline, they were all over the place. 'There was nobody in there today that said ""right, we're going to get two banks of four, hard to beat and actually try to grind out a result"".'","Manchester City lost 4-2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday .

The native Australian marsupial once occupied more than 70 per cent of the Australian mainland while now it’s disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area with small populations remaining in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Kevin Bradley, CEO of Save the Bilby Fund told Daily Mail Australia that it’s very difficult to pin point the exact number of bilbies left in Australia because of their ‘cryptic’ nocturnal habits. Scroll down for video . The native Australian marsupial once occupied more than 70 per cent of the Australian mainland while now it’s disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area . ‘We know they are extinct in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia with very few bilbies left in Queensland and scattered populations in the Northern Territory and Western Australia’ 'Things aren’t looking great and their future in the wild is very tenuous.’ In recent years the bilby has become an important part of the Australian Easter tradition however, its ties with our Indigenous community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories. Mr Bradley said the critters were of 'high significance to traditional land owners' with record of bilby populations dating back '15 million years'. Until recently, Australia had two species of Bilbies- the Greater Bilby and the Lesser Bilby. The Lesser Bilby is already believed to be extinct while the Greater Bilby is classed as ‘endangered’ in Queensland and ‘vulnerable’ nationally. In recent years the bilby has become an important part of the Australian Easter tradition however, its ties with our Indigenous community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories. Predators like feral cats and foxes are the biggest threat to the bilby populations while other contributing factors include farm animals destroying bilby habitat and introduced species like rabbits competing with them for food and burrows. Mr Bradley said foxes and feral cats are ‘desimating the population.’ The Australian Wildlife Conservancy said feral cats are the driving force behind the dramatic decline of wildlife across the country with the feral felines killing an estimated 75 million native animals every night. 'I think people are starting to recognise that these animals are having such a devastating effect on many native animal populations.' Mr Bradley said the Federal Government has committed to a National Feral Animal Summit this year that will  focus on creating a plan to address the feral cat issue. In the mean time, the Save the Bilby Fund have developed a captive breeding program and believe that continuing breeding efforts in controlled environments could be they key to saving the endangered marsupial. The Greater Bilby is a nocturnal marsupial with a silky grey and white coat and a long black and white tail. Bilbies have large ears, a long snouts and a great sense of smell that helps them locate food. The bilby is omnivorous and eats bulbs, fruit, seeds, fungi, insects, worms, termintes and even small lizards or spiders. They don’t need regular water because, like koalas, they get most of their water from their food. The Royal Visit: Even the Royal family, pictured, wanted to drop by to get some face time with the native marsupial .","Bilby numbers are dropping with only around 600 left in Queensland .

Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, was taken to UCLA Medical Center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home. She remains at the hospital, according to Leslie Morris' court petition filed April 28. Morris is described as Mitchell's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents. Whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion. In her April 28 petition, Morris says Mitchell is unconscious: ""At this time she (Mitchell) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses, and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs."" But on Mitchell's website, a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by Morris says Mitchell is alert. ""Contrary to rumors circulating on the Internet today, Joni is not in a coma. Joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital."" When asked about the discrepancy between statements about Mitchell's health on her website and in the legal filing, her publicist, Alisse Kingsley, responded that ""the website"" was accurate.

360,69af3b9fc4ba1fa6bd272c82d17ec318da5ff97a,"(CNN)When I was elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body.  Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about ""expanding the Republican Party"" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring ""I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back.""  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks ""should be done away with;"" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, ""We have an African-American President."" When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: ""With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. ... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote."" America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.  The American people deserve better than Rand Paul.","Georgia Powers: Rand Paul, running for president, would like minorities to think he's an advocate. His record on rights shows otherwise .

Attorney Cathy Hale who is representing the couple said that the sister of the bride  waited to tell her about what happened until after the wedding because she didn't want to ruin her special day or upset her. 'She made the wise decision not to tell her and spoil that specific day,' Hale told Click2Houston.

365,f0bd9de49bd9e4ae617e8ceccdd2726afe542ce3,"The stylist behind singer Rita Ora's unique, over-the-top hairstyles has revealed how much work the chart-topper has to put into ensuring her blonde locks remain totally healthy. Chris Appleton, who has been working with natural brunette Rita, 24, for the past two years, confessed to Daily Mail Online that her demanding haircare routine does require a hefty amount of work and 'maintenance'. 'We have to color the hair every three weeks,' he explained. 'We've managed to get the timing perfect so that she's not coloring it all the time. If you keep bleaching it, you push it too far and it can look awful, which has been done in the past by other celebrities! Scroll down for video . Style icon: Chris Appleton (R) has been working as singer Rita Ora's hairstylist for two years . Haircare regimen: According to Chris, Rita's blonde locks need to be colored every three weeks, a process which can dry out the hair if done too frequently . 'I also make my own hair masks, which I make her sleep in, to ensure that her hair stays in the best condition possible. 'I'm so strict with Rita, I want to make sure that her hair always looks great, and that means a lot of work. When she has any spare time, I make her condition.' But despite the seemingly endless hours of maintenance required in order to keep Rita's barnet looking its best, Chris insists that the singer isn't planning to follow in Kim Kardashian's footsteps and make a change to brunette any time soon. 'Blonde is such a statement, despite the fact that it's a lot of maintenance behind the scenes,' he said. 'We've never done anything deep or dark and we change the actual style so much that I'm eager to keep the color consistent.' The singer did have a chance to experiment with a darker hairstyle when she appeared in the recently-released Fifty Shades of Grey movie however; Rita's role as Mia, the younger sister of charismatic businessman Christian Grey, saw her don an extremely short, dark wig, which Chris believes helped Rita to separate herself from the character. Innovation: Every hairstyle that Rita models has something unique and different about it. 'I always want to do something to make her hair look special,' Chris explains . The girl with the pearl... hair: This embellished hairstyle is one of Chris' favorites . 'It worked for the film, because she wasn't Rita, she was Mia Grey, and I think that was a good thing,' Chris said. 'But I don't know if it's a style we will be trying out on Rita in real life!' While Rita might not be planning to replicate Mia's severe hairstyle any time soon however, Chris says that she is certainly not averse to experimenting with a variety of different looks - be they temporary, or permanent. Indeed, the decision to cut Rita's hair into a much shorter style just a few months ago was actually made on a whim, during a late-night styling session. 'I was talking to Rita about chopping her hair for a year, but it was about finding the right time,' he explained. 'Then at two in the morning, I was working on her hair, and we'd been doing it for hours, and she just said: ""I think it's time."" 'She called me the next day and was so happy with it, which was great. And it looks amazing, it was just a bit weird that we decided to do it then and there so late at night, or early in the morning I guess.' CopyKaty: According to Chris, singer Katy Perry recreated two of Rita's hairstyles for her This is How We Do video . Something different: For her role as Mia Grey in the recently-released movie Fifty Shades of Grey, Rita had the chance to experiment with darker locks . And beyond the length and color of Rita's hair, Chris is determined to ensure that her style is always fresh, unique and interesting, and is often experimenting with different textures, embellishments and colorful accessories. 'Sometimes I get a lot of time to work on a look - I'll know what outfit she's planning to wear for a red carpet, or an appearance, and I can plan accordingly,' he explained. 'Other times, I don't really get any time at all and I just have to pull it out of the bag! 'But I always want to do something to make her hair look special; if she's wearing a really detailed dress and we want the hair to be more simple, I'll do something really subtle - like the gold leaf that we used in her parting at the 2014 Met Gala. 'But if we want to go all out, then we'll work with loads of different accessories, or colors. I loved when we sewed loads of pearls into her hair, I thought that looked amazing. And it was so different and unique.' 'It's all about the details - I’m all about adding details to the hair. People will watch, [so] make it worthwhile.' Put a ring on it: Chris and Rita will often work together in order to come up with a new and unique way of accessorizing her hairstyle . Twisted: Rita often showcases Chris' work on her Instagram account . While Chris admits that he and Rita don't always see eye-to-eye about what hairstyle they should go for, he adds that she is always willing to go the extra mile in order to create something that is totally unique. And it seems that the seemingly endless hours Rita and Chris have spent working on maintaining and perfecting her varied hairstyles have more than paid off, with many of the more elaborate styles inspiring numerous other celebrities and style icons to create similar looks. 'The people behind the new Star Wars movie loved the hair we created for the UK version of The Voice [on which Rita is a judge] so much that they are going to use it in their next film,' Chris revealed. 'Katy Perry also did a similar style to the gelled baby hair that Rita had at Coachella for her This is How We Do video. 'The same look was also used at a number of fashion shows including DKNY and Givenchy.' 'Chris is incredibly talented,' Rita says of her ongoing relationship with the hairstylist. 'We work so well together drawing inspiration from any number of things - from Marilyn Monroe to London street fashion. Chris is always up for creating real moments, trying something different while keeping me smiling the whole way.'","Hairstylist Chris Appleton explained the inspiration for 24-year-old Rita's unique and over-the-top hairstyles .

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady also threw a first pitch, at Fenway Park in Boston - but didn't do himself proud, chucking the ball straight at the ground.

Taya Kyle gets a hug from San Diego Padres starting pitcher Andrew Cashner after throwing out the first ceremonial pitch . De Blasio's relations with the police unions and some rank-and-file officers were fractured in the aftermath of the December shooting that claimed the lives of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. They were murdered on patrol in Brooklyn on December 20 by a crazed gunman who then committed suicide. Since that crisis, which threatened to overwhelm the mayor's agenda, de Blasio has taken pains to repair relations with the nation's largest police force, brokering a new union contract, investing in new technology and training, and doubling down on his public praise of the department. On Monday, he joined the tens of thousands of fans in cheering as the officers' images were displayed on the park's giant video screens and again when Ramos' two sons and Liu's widow threw out the pitches to Mets players David Wright, Matt Harvey and Curtis Granderson. De Blasio, however, was largely booed when he was introduced to the crowd. A year ago, de Blasio was also booed as he threw out the first pitch (a strike). Both years, he sported a Mets cap and jersey, which was emblazoned with his last name and the number 6, a tribute to Rico Petrocelli, a longtime shortstop on de Blasio's favorite team, the Boston Red Sox. Petrocelli, like de Blasio, was also of Italian descent and lived in Brooklyn. The tribute to the NYPD comes as de Blasio is weighing a City Council proposal to hire 1,000 more police officers. The idea has been endorsed by union leaders who said it would reduce pressure on existing officers to keep crime low. But de Blasio rejected an identical council proposal a year ago, pointing to the city's record low crime and suggesting that the money would be better spent elsewhere.

Members of the Liu and Ramos families, including Yenjian Liu's widow, Pei Xia Chen, second from left, throw out the ceremonial first pitch . Police Commissioner William Bratton has, at times, signaled support for the effort to hire more officers for the department, which now has a headcount of about 34,500, about 6,000 fewer than at its peak in 2001. De Blasio has not committed to hiring more officers but has been more receptive to the proposal in his public remarks than he was a year ago. The council's budget office projected that hiring two new classes of officers, to total 1,000, would cost nearly $69m in the upcoming fiscal year. But the council believes that the cost will be offset by the corresponding reduction in overtime.

The home side laid siege to the Thistle defence at the start of the match but had to rely on a Kris Commons penalty a minute before the break to give them the interval lead. Thistle midfielder James Craigen had been shown a straight red card by referee Willie Collum for a 'last man' foul on Hoops midfielder Stuart Armstrong to concede the spot-kick. leaving the visitors a player down for the second half. Stuart Armstrong is brought down by Partick Thistle's James Craigen leading to a penalty . Referee Willie Collum shows Craigen a read card for his 'last man' challenge on Armstrong . Celtic striker Kris Commons steps up to convert the penalty to give his side a 1-0 lead before the break . Commons (right) races away to celebrates his 45th minute penalty strike . Midfielder Stefan Johansen, stand-in skipper in the absence of suspended Scott Brown, added a second in the 63rd minute as the encounter turned into a Hoops procession. With second-placed Aberdeen beating Inverness 1-0, Ronny Deila's side maintained the gap over the Dons but also have a game in hand as the title race draws closer to conclusion. With a heavy schedule in mind, the Hoops boss returned midfielder Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and striker John Guidetti his starting line-up. Thistle manager Alan Archibald was forced into one change with forward Kallum Higginbotham coming in for the injured Kris Doolan but he was mostly a spectator as the Firhill defence was forced to withstand an early Hoops' barrage. Celtic came close twice before two minutes had elapsed. Stefan Johansen doubles Celtic's advantage in the 63rd minute with left-footed shot into the bottom corner . Johansen is mobbed by his team-mates following his second-half strike . Parkhead defender Virgil van Dijk, up for a corner, flicked an Armstrong cross against the crossbar at the near post before a desperate blocking tackle by Maryhill defender Conrad Balatoni prevented an almost certain goal from Johansen's drive. Balatoni again came to Thistle rescue in the ninth minute, beating Guidetti to a header in front of an empty goal, after left-back Emilio Izaguirre had troubled Fox after surging into the penalty area. Moments later, Mackay-Steven was set up Johansen but his goalbound drive from 12 yards was deflected away by Thistle defender Callum Booth. Yet, in the 21st minute, in a rare attack, the visitors almost snatched the lead but Higginbotham's spectacular volley from 14 yards was saved by Craig Gordon - but only on the stretch. Commons' long-distance drive in the 28th minute just cleared the bar but a minute before the break he was more accurate from the spot, firing the penalty low into the corner giving the despairing Fox no chance. Leigh Griffiths spurns a glorious opportunity to put Celtic 3-0 ahead late in the match . The goal came as some relief to the home fans who had grown slightly irritated as the first half wore on. Two minutes after the break Commons forced Fox into a decent save with a powerful 25-yard drive and while the Maryhill defence cleared their lines from rebound it looked ominous. Thistle continued to defend stoutly and desperately in equal measures but were undone again when Johansen took a clever Guidetti pass before rolling the ball into the corner of the net from 10 yards. Two minutes after replacing Guidetti, Leigh Griffiths somehow turned a Mackay-Steven cross past the far post from two yards out but it was inconsequential. In the 79th minute, with the game drifting, Gordon made another good save, this time from Thistle substitute Gary Fraser, on for Stuart Bannigan. Johansen came close at the other end with a chip which Fox tipped over the bar, after the Norwegian had weaved his way through the Jags defence.","Kris Commons fired Celtic into the lead on the stroke of half-time .

Now that Battle of Britain – potentially at Wembley Stadium – may never take place. So says Khan's father Shah as his son gets ready to finally confirm the over-criticised Chris Algieri as his opponent in New York on the same night when Brook will be defending his world welterweight title against Gavin at London's O2 Arena on May 20 . Promoter Eddie Hearn (centre) stands behind Kell Brook (left) and Frankie Gavin at the O2 Arena . Amir Khan celebrates his victory over Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas last year . Shah Khan, who also supervises affairs, says: 'Kell could have had his chance against Amir right now if Eddie Hearn had toned it down. But instead of being patient he's been so disrespectful. 'If he carries on like that the Brook fight will not take place. He keeps shouting about how much the fight is worth but I don't care about the money. For Amir it's more about the big fights and his status in boxing. 'Amir's told Kell he will be happy to box him in the next year but Eddie's jeopardising that. He carries on calling us out and insulting us. Any more of that and it will be all over. 'Kell has said plenty, too. But we don't think this is his fault. He seems a good lad. It's Eddie putting the words in his mouth.' Initially, Hearn's provocative manoeuvres came as a surprise to the rival camp. Khan Snr says: 'Eddie will talk reasonably in the negotiating room. Pleasant with us. But as soon as he gets outside he starts with the nonsense.' Hearn (centre) speaks during a press conference to announce the fight between Brook and Gavin . Khan (right) poses for a photo alongside father Shah (centre) and brother Haroon in Sheffield in 2013 . The Khans see a telling parable with the way Junior Witter's critical harassment of Ricky Hatton offended the Hitman. 'Ricky became annoyed and it was hard to blame him,' says Shah. 'It was a fight he would have been happy to take but when the words became unpleasant he walked away for good. 'And what's happened to Witter after that? Virtually nothing. Now he's more less forgotten. I can see the same happening to Kell. 'Yet Brook is a fight Amir would have been more than happy to have. We feel it's a fairly comfortable fight for us. Kell has done OK but we sense that as soon as he comes up against a fighter of Amir's elite level he will be found out. 'Eddie needs to calm down.' If what is being described as the biggest domestic fight in waiting is to become reality, it is over to you Mr Hearn. Eddie, a fellow columnist here at Sportsmail, has pushed through a number of matches with his outspoken pubic challenges. But last week he drew a frosty response from Carl Frampton and his legendary promoter Barry McGuigan when he brandished at them a cheque for £1.5million for the Belfast Jackal to meet his man Scott Quigg in a world super-bantamweight title unification fight. Brook (left) and Gavin (right) go face to face as promoter Hearn looks on in the background . Hearn displays the cheque for £1.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Khan has taken flak for lining up Algieri for his next fight, after the New Yorker was decked six times en route to an embarrassing, wipe-out defeat by Manny Pacquaio. But Algieiri did defeat the previously feared Russian puncher Ruslan Provodnikov to win the world lightweight title, which he still holds. And Khan says: 'Gavin hasn't done anything to compare with that. Sadly Frankie's recent performances against comparatively weak opposition have been anything but convincing. Good luck to him getting the pay-night but he's done nothing to justify this world title shot.' Khan jumped the gun in announcing Algieri and the May 20 date at the Barclays Center in New York, since his advisor Al Haymon was still finalising the deal. Chris Algieri (left) takes on Manny Pacquiao in a WBO welterweight title bout in Macau last year . But all seems to be in place now and the official statement should come this week. Khan was criticised, also, for allegedly declining the IBF offer of a final eliminator against Tim Bradley for Brook's belt. Khan Snr says: 'We couldn't really see the point of an eliminator a fight which Brook is so desperate to have.' His son was also accused of being less than truthful for saying he knew nothing about the offer. But there are suggestions that the secretive Haymon dismissed the IBF offer out of hand, without informing Khan. Paul Smith, having bravely lost his two challenges to Arthur Abraham in Germany, now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion. Only this time the elder of Liverpool's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title, even though it is against a far more formidable champion. Andre Ward, still ranked by many among the top five pound-for-pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring, sees Smith as the ideal warm-up opponent, possibly before a rematch with Carl Froch. Paul Smith (right) throws a punch towards Arthur Abraham during their title fight in Berlin in February . Virgil Hunter, California-based trainer of both Ward and Amir Khan, says: 'Smith is who we want and I'm told it's a done deal. But it won't be for Andre's belt even though it will be over the 12-round championship distance.' The WBA have ordered their two super-middle world champions – Ward 'super,' Froch 'regular' – to meet in a unification fight. Froch declared willingness if Ward returns the compliment by travelling to the UK, having won their first meeting in the US. Ward said he would make the away trip but only as far as London, not to Nottingham where Froch has long desired to box on his hometown City Ground. Andre Ward (left) poses with his many title belts after defeating Edwin Rodriguez in November 2013 . Hunter declares: 'Andre would have gladly taken Carl straight away.' But now it appears the WBA are granting the so-called Son of God licence to shake off the ring rust where he almost always fights, in his native city across the Bay from San Francisco. Froch, meanwhile, is turning his attention to his other remaining ambition before retirement – a first appearance on the Las Vegas Strip, against the namesake son of Mexican legend Julio Cesar Chavez. Step into Oakland's Oracle Arena, Paul Smith. Good luck to him, in every sense of the phrase.

A woman has been branded a 'menace to the community' after she posed as both a council warden and a church official to bluff her way into sheltered housing complexes to steal from vulnerable residents. Julie Walters, 49, has been jailed for two and a half years after she pretended to be a trusted official to dupe elderly victims out of cash. She was caught by police after she was spotted on CCTV loitering in the communal hall of a retirement property near to the Old Trafford football ground in Manchester before an 80-year-old man and an 81-year-old woman were fleeced in two separate attacks. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters of Withington, Manchester, hanging around outside the complex after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court. The court heard how the first victim, a man aged 81, was targeted at about midday on February 25 this year when he was walking back to his sheltered accommodation. He saw Walters get out of a taxi and she asked him for money, claiming she needed to pay the taxi and then go into town. Mistakenly thinking she was one of the wardens, he gave her about £30 in cash. The next day she returned to the man’s address, claiming she worked there, and needed to check his bathroom. After tricking her way inside, she stole his wallet and £100 in cash. Walters struck again on March 2 at the home of an 80-year-old man who lives at another retirement home. She falsely claimed she was from the church which convinced the man to let her inside. Walters then rifled through the kitchen, stealing his wallet containing between £50 to £60 in cash. Later that day and at the same retirement home, Walters targeted the home of an 81-year-old woman, claiming she was from 'the council' and needed to use the toilet. Once inside, she stole a £5 note from the woman’s handbag but was caught red-handed. When confronted she simply put the note on the coffee table and left. Walters was identified on the CCTV footage by a beat police officer and she was arrested on March 4. Investigations showed she had booked taxis to drop her off and then pick her up at times and locations matching those of the three burglaries. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters hanging around outside a complex, where she targeted two residents, after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court . After the case Detective Sergeant Rachel Smith of Greater Manchester Police said: “Walters is devoid of conscience and scruples. “She is also extremely manipulative, not only in terms of tricking her way into the homes of vulnerable people but also targeting those she thinks are too frail or elderly to recognise her or give evidence in court. “In fact, in this case, one of the victims did feel he was too old to go to court but thankfully the woman who caught her red-handed positively picked her out of an identity parade and that, combined with the CCTV and mobile phone evidence we found, created an overwhelming case against Walters. “I cannot overstate what a menace to the community Walters is but thanks to this excellent investigation, she is now starting a lengthy jail sentence and the streets are much safer with her behind bars. “I would also like to commend the victims for giving their statements despite some reservations about their age. 'By doing so, they have not only helped effect justice for themselves but also saved other potential victims a great deal of heartache.”","Julie Walters pretended to be trusted official to gain access to care homes .

I'm surprised they don't analyse it in the TV deals. I'm surprised a game of the same stature is played at the same time. There's a little conflict there. It's difficult to understand.' 'We would like it to be a unique competition that's played, especially a semi-final or final and don't want it to be conflicting with other competitions. It's a very big game (at Chelsea). It's a surprise to me.' Wenger admits a United win at Chelsea could open up the title race again. 'Mathematically yes,' he said. 'But we have to keep winning.' Klopp confirmed on Wednesday his intention to leave Dortmund at the end of the season after seven years in which the club won two Bundesliga titles and reached the Champions League final. It sparked a frenzy of speculation about whether the charismatic 47-year-old might be destined for England with Arsenal or Manchester City, where manager Manuel Pellegrini is feeling the heat after a poor run of form. Wenger hit out at the TV scheduling as Manchester United's trip to Chelsea clashes with the semi-final . Wenger has branded the 'circus' around Jurgen Klopp's resignation as 'ridiculous' 'I'm not an agency to place managers,' said Wenger, when asked about Klopp's announcement. 'I like every manager and respect, everybody. I find that circus a bit ridiculous. 'It's down to every club to make the right decision and to respect Dortmund. Dortmund is a massive club and will survive, they have the ability to keep their best players. They have a big history linked with great results and great achievements so I don't think that will stop for Dortmund.' Arsenal will have Jack Wilshere available for the semi-final against Reading, as he trained on Thursday with the club at their base. Wojciech Szczesny will start in the tie, and was also put through his paces during Arsenal's training session. The Gunners boss says his team have learned from last season, when they fell behind at this stage against Wigan and needed penalties to beat the Championship side. 'It's my 10th semi-final and that means we know how to prepare but it's always tricky,' he added. 'We learned from Wigan last year. It's always a special occasion to share with our fans. We want them to go home happy.' Wenger confirmed that second-choice keeper Wojciech Szczesny will start at Wembley on Saturday .

""For me those faces are like maps,"" Lazar said. ""The more you look at them, the more you are discovering."" Soviet authorities invaded Poland during World War II and deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. Some were sent to prison camps in the frozen wilderness of central Russia. Many were children. In effect, Moscow stole much of an entire generation of young Poles, a handful of whom Lazar has located seven decades later. During Lazar's interviews, many of the survivors broke down in tears. ""It was very traumatic for them,"" he said. ""Some lost mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters -- killed by the Soviets."" Lazar remembers hearing 84-year-old Boguslaw Dokurno recall his grandfather's dying wish. Dokurno's grandfather asked his grandson to return home to Poland after his death to retrieve Polish soil and bring it back to his Siberian gravesite.

The number of deaths every year in Britain – which have been falling for the past 40 years – will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as the lives of unprecedented numbers born in the post-baby boom come to an end. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers’ bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Loss of baby boomers: The number of UK deaths per will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past ten years . The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. ‘After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,’ it said. ‘As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.’ Expensive end: A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, an old age think tank has found . It added: ‘This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.’ Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: ‘More than half of UK households have less than £3,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. ‘We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable. State support for funerals is complex and inadequate and without reforms will contribute to more people falling victim to funeral debt.’ The report said that funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past 10 years and costs are set to go up further. A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, it found. However a family that wants to throw in a memorial stone, death notices, flowers, limousines, a wake and somewhere to hold it, is likely to be looking at spending almost £2,000 more. An average ‘full works’ funeral now costs £5,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. Crematoria now need to cover costs for removing fillings from the teeth of the dead, for example, because they must remove mercury from the body before disposal. Funeral firms are under growing costs pressures, not least because some families cannot or will not pay their bills, and the fees for a Church of England vicar to conduct the funeral went up in 2013 from £102 to £160. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.","Number of UK deaths per will rise by 20% over the next two decades .

Pension firms said Britons remained baffled about how the radical changes worked, with many unaware of age restrictions or tax implications. Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity. And yesterday, the first people to cash in their pots began to receive their money. Scroll down for video . Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity . The Government had said that everyone over the age of 55 who wanted to take part in the new pension freedoms would be given a free half-hour session of guidance but just 300 advisers are available (file picture) But one major provider reported that customers in their 20s had been calling up to withdraw their retirement savings – unaware they were three decades too young. Others were unaware they faced a hefty tax bill if they removed all their cash at once. The confusion was not helped by a decision to pull the plug on television adverts promoting the Government's pensions helpline. The Treasury said that, ahead of the election, it had switched to a 'low level' advertising campaign for its Pension Wise guidance service and dropped its television adverts for almost two months. 'Purdah' rules bar Government advertising campaigns before a general election so that it does not promote the cause of a certain political party. But experts said barring TV adverts which raise awareness of the pension changes would punish consumers, some of whom were already confused by the changes. Experts fear pensioners could be vulnerable  if they do not receive proper advice regarding pension plans now that over-55s can cash in their pensions and spend them  instead of being forced to buy an annuity (file image) David Trenner, of Intelligent Pensions, said it was 'crazy to stop advertising Pension Wise under Purdah rules', while Catriona Standingford, who runs a financial training firm, asked on Twitter: Shouldn't the consumer/taxpayer come first?.' The Treasury said the service will only be advertised through print and digital advertising for April and most of May. Pensions firm Fidelity Worldwide Investment said it had taken 1,300 calls about the pension freedoms in the last week alone. But several calls a day have been from people under-55 trying to access their cash, including a 23-year-old who mistakenly believed they could 'get hold of their pot now'. Richard Parkin, of Fidelity, said: 'Misunderstandings exist around when you can access your funds. 'Since the new freedoms were announced, we've received a steady number of calls from people under the age of 55 who think they can access their funds under the new rules.'","Pension firms said Britons remain baffled about how radical changes work .

376,ee328187df02d98bb236fa9f144c027e37dba9b3,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)A border guard was killed in a cross-boundary fire exchange with militants in Yemen this week, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported Thursday -- marking Saudi Arabia's first publicly known military death since it launched airstrikes against rebels inside its southern neighbor. The clash occurred Wednesday night at the border in southwestern Saudi Arabia's Asir region, when militants in a mountainous area on the Yemeni side fired on Saudi border troops, prompting them to return fire, SPA reported. Besides the slain border guard -- identified as Cpl. Salman Ali Yahya al-Maliki -- 10 others suffered injuries that were not life-threatening, the Saudi media outlet said. On Thursday, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, a neutral security official and two Houthi commanders in Aden told CNN. The palace had been where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who fled the country last month, had stayed for a period of time after Houthis secured control of the capital, Sanaa, in January. According to the security official, Houthis now control most large districts in Aden amid ongoing clashes. Yemeni special forces, considered pro-Houthi and loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, arrived in Aden on Thursday in an attempt ""to secure the city,"" a Saudi official with knowledge of the situation told CNN. ""I can now confirm that it is not Saudi special forces who have landed but Yemeni special forces loyal to Saleh who landed by small boat. They are few in number and have made their way to the old parliament building,"" the intelligence official said. U.S. Navy warships, meanwhile, were patrolling off Yemen in search of suspicious shipping in the region, in particular any weapons shipments from Iran to the Houthi rebels they are supporting in Yemen, a U.S. defense official told CNN. The Navy on Wednesday came across a Panamanian-registered cargo ship that had left an Iranian port, the official said. Based on the route of the ship from Iran to Yemen, the Navy declared it a ""vessel of interest"" and requested permission from the captain to search it. The ship was found to be carrying cement and construction materials, the official said. It was sent on its way. The offshore area has been a route for weapons smuggling into Yemen, as well as Sudan and Gaza, so the Navy has maintained a regular surveillance presence there. The official said that increased fighting in the last several days in southern Yemen has resulted in other ships trying to dock to help civilians leave the country. Marie Claire Feghali, an International Committee of the Red Cross spokeswoman in Sanaa, described events in Aden as ""extremely fluid and very, very complicated."" ""Hospitals are still struggling, running out of supplies. So are we,"" she said. ""We cannot move much in Aden due to the intense fighting and chaos."" A hospital near heavy fighting was forced to shut down. Officials: Al Qaeda fighters free 270 from Yemeni prisons .

And speaking after second-half goals from Mame Diouf and substitute Charlie Adam saw his side roar back after Morgan Schneiderlin had given Ronald Koeman’s Southampton a deserved lead, manager Hughes added that he was hopeful of keeping Begovic at the club. Stoke City have opened talks over a contract extension for in-demand goalkeeper Asmir Begovic .

Jonathan Walters (left) congratulates fellow Stoke striker Mame Biram Diouf (right) after his goal on Saturday . ‘We want to be a team that’s consistently in the top ten,’ said a beaming Hughes whose side rose to ninth in the table. ‘To be able to do that you need key players in key areas of the field and obviously goalkeeper is a key position in any good team and Asmir has been exceptional for us for a long time now.’ Both Manchester clubs have watched the 27-year-old but Hughes thinks Stoke have a chance of persuading him to stay. The win over Southampton on Saturday was Stoke’s first over them since February 2008 when an own goal from Darren Powell and efforts from Ryan Shawcross and Mamady Sidibe secured a 3-2 triumph. ‘We’re talking and those talks are going to be concluded in the summer,’ he said. ‘Hopefully they are going to be concluded in our favour.’ Next up for Saints, who missed the chance to close the gap on Manchester City in fourth place to two points, is a home meeting with Tottenham - and the return to St Mary’s of former boss Mauricio Pochettino.

In his column for skysports.com, Merson wrote: 'If Andros Townsend can get in then it opens it up for anybody. We are not picking players who are playing well for their clubs – he got taken off after 30 minutes the other week against United. 'The England manager is there watching the game and he still gets picked. Townsend and Kyle Walker were the worst two players on the pitch. 'How can you tell me that a manager goes and watches Man United against Tottenham, the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes, the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full-back for England and Ashley Young doesn’t get in the squad?' ‘He said when the squad was announced that I should be “nowhere near the squad”. It didn’t really annoy me, but gave me the extra incentive to silence a few critics. Hopefully I’ve done that as I always have.’ Merson had made his comments on Sky Sports when Roy Hodgson named the players for games against Lithuania and Italy. The 1-1 draw in Turin had not long ended when Townsend (below) tweeted to his 285,000 followers: ‘Not bad for a player that should be “nowhere near the squad” ay @PaulMerse?’ The Tottenham’s winger’s father Troy joined in, too, tweeting: “Oh ye of little faith #Merson get in.’ They could also have pointed out that Townsend’s screamer was his third for England, taking him level with Merson. ‘You can never stop proving things to people,’ said Townsend. ‘But I think every time I’ve put on an England shirt I have done myself justice, I have done Roy Hodgson justice and the nation justice. I was a bit disappointed with his comments but I have come on the pitch and silenced them.' Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson (centre) criticised Townsend's call-up to the England squad last week . Harry Kane congratulates his Tottenham team-mate Townsend after the final whistle in Turin . Good-natured north London Twitter skirmishing aside, there will have been a few Spurs supporters who understood Merson’s point. Townsend’s form has been inconsistent, and having seen him come off the bench to score for England they will wonder why he cannot do it more often for Tottenham. ‘I can’t put my finger on it or tell you what it is,’ admitted Townsend, when asked about the contrast. ‘The (England) manager has always given me confidence to go and express myself and play my natural game. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s my best form but this is the best form I’ve produced this season. I have had a few injury problems but I’m over the worst of that. ‘I’m slowly building my confidence back to where it was and hopefully from now until the end of the season I can get more games for Spurs and England and get back to the football I was producing last season.’ After long-range goals against Montenegro and San Marino, Townsend enjoyed the one he flashed past Gianluigi Buffon on Tuesday. It came from his weaker, right foot, against elite opposition and he made a beeline for Buffon after the match to ask for his shirt as a souvenir. ‘He is a top goalkeeper — one of the best to ever play the game — so to score past him I thought was no mean feat,’ said Townsend. ‘As soon as the whistle went, I thought I’d go and get his shirt because it is a real night to savour for me.’ Roy Hodgson was also impressed with Townsend after the Tottenham winger's fine goal after the break .","Andros Townsend scored the equaliser in England's 1-1 draw with Italy .

381,7c0d2467986e4e8cf55269e7d3b7e8cfa44b1abd,"The casket of promising basketball player Lauren Hill has been moved into the 10,000-seater arena where she made her first basket in a college game just five months ago. The 19-year-old defied doctors' expectations after she was diagnosed with a rare form of inoperable brain cancer just after her 18th birthday. She was told she would not live past December but died four months later this month after playing with her college team at Mount St Joseph University in Cincinnati to raise $1.5million for research into childhood cancer. Scroll down for video . The casket of  basketball player Lauren Hill was placed at the site where she made her first basket five months ago, before she died of an inoperable brain tumour this month. Her high school team mates gathered to remember her at a memorial today in the arena where she scored her first basket for her college team . Today mourners at the arena celebrated her life and determination in the face of the obstacles she overcame in her short life. Hill was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma after she became dizzy following a basketball game with her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. The tumour is found on the brain stem and can cause double vision and difficulty controlling facial expressions. Due to its position at the back of the brain treatment can be particularly difficult and it is impossible to operate on, making prognosis poor. After doctors found the tumour just after the teenager's 18th birthday she was told she had just two years left. But in September, as her condition worsened, she was told she would not last until December. The Mount St Joseph freshman devoted her final year to playing basketball, raising money for cancer research, and inspiring others. She played four games, raising $1.5million for pediatric cancer and leaving a legacy of fundraising that will be continued after her death. When her condition began to worsen and she became too ill to play, Hill helped out the team as a coach. Lauren Hill was a keen basketball player but she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was inoperable and significantly changed her appearance as she resolved to carry on playing in the final months of her life (right) The treatment she had significantly altered her appearance but she was determined to keep playing and raising funds for as along as she could. Before the season started, the US Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. This was noted again at the women's Final Four a week ago. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. Basketball star LeBron James posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. Hill is seen shooting a lay up during the November 2 game - her first for the Mount St Joseph's team . During her first NCAA college basketball game on November Hill gave a thumbs-up as she holds the ball . 'She made you think:"" What am I doing with my life?"" said Lexy Saraswate, 19, a Xavier student who volunteered to work at the memorial service. ""How can I be a better person?"" 'Just her courage. I felt that was the thing: What do you do when you're staring death in the face? She set a goal for herself and accomplished it, even surpassed it. She's an inspiration.' Hill's casket was brought by a hearse to Xavier's Cintas Center - the site where she made a left-handed layup to open a Division III game on November 2. The match was moved forward to this date with permission of the NCAA because of her declining condition. Hill parents, Brent (left, front) and LIsa (right) entered the Cintas Center for their daughter's memorial . Hill's high school basketball team, the Lawrenceburg Tigers, carried her jersey and a net into the memorial . Memorabilia from Hill's basketball career including a ball, net and her jersey, were placed by the casket . The public memorial was held at Xavier University in Cincinnati, with Hill's casket decorated with flowers . Mr and Mrs Hill (right) followed the casket at the conclusion of the hour-long memorial service in Cincinnati . The arena was packed for the game, which started with a set play to get her a left-handed layup. She also made a right-handed layup late in the game, sealing the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. The backboard and basket were off to the side, with the attached game clock and shot clock set to 22 — her number. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . Coach Dan Benjamin gently kissed her gray No. 22 jersey before stretching it over the casket. Former teammates dabbed their eyes with tissues as they sat in folding chairs on the floor. A few thousand people stood silently in the stands. 'She has revealed to us that one person can make a difference,' said Dr. Mariko DeWire, one of her physicians. 'She truly is our victorious hero.' A video of the layup she made only 17 seconds into Mount St. Joseph's 66-55 win over Hiram College in the season-opening game was also played. In a highly personal one hour ceremony songs from the basketball player's iPod were played. The second song on her playlist was James Taylor's 'You've Got A Friend.' One of her favorite songs — Katy Perry's 'Roar' — was played as her casket was wheeled out to a standing ovation. Hill will be buried in a private service on Wednesday. Family photos flanked the casket, along with a photo of her in a cape and a quote from actor Christopher Reeve: 'A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere in spite of overwhelming obstacles.' Hill tried to make the last months of her life about helping and inspiring other people. Through a nonprofit foundation, she helped to raise roughly $1.5 million for research into pediatric cancer. Shortly before she died, she set a goal of raising $2.2 million — matching her uniform number. Hill's team mates at Mount St Joseph University gathered to remember the teenager and her efforts . Mourners were played a video which showed her achievements during her successful basketball career . People gathered to attend the one hour long memorial service at Xavier University in Cincinnati . The fundraising campaign will continue through the school and the foundation. A number of people have praised the teenager's courage and determination as she battled her condition. 'Lauren chose to be the victor,' said the Reverend Corey Potts from her church in Indiana. 'When she was in the hospital, I went to see Lauren expecting to cheer her up. And she cheered me up.'

383,ce02bb0eabbde2c97e451d4c65aff8a64a722a3a,"This year has seen a rash of massive dust storms around the world that have led to travel chaos and blocked out sunlight - but experts cannot pinpoint the reason behind the spate. This week incredible footage showed the moment an unusual 'apocalyptic' dust storm, known in Arabic as a haboob, struck Belarus, turning day to night, and China has suffered four massive sandstorms since the start of the year. Some experts have said that climate change bringing excessive heat can make some areas more susceptible to dust storms, but one European scientist pointed out that the number of dust storms over the decades has always been variable. Dark clouds start forming over the city of Soligorsk, Belarus, as a sandstorm sweeps over the city . Within a matter of minutes, the storm had blocked out the sun, creating chaos on the city streets . A raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . Golmud was left covered in a remarkable red haze when the sand cloud blew across the city . The footage of the dust storm in Belarus, filmed from a high rise apartment, shows traffic moving along a busy street in the province of Salihorsk, south of the capital of Minsk on Monday afternoon. As dark clouds move over the city, the entire area is plunged into darkness - forcing motorists to turn on their lights as they navigate the darkened roads. The storm was caused by a cold front moving in from the Ukrainian-Belorusian border, reported RT. Earlier this month Britain was shrouded in a cloud of Saharan dust, known as 'blood rain,' as the temperatures soared. Blurred: The Shard, one of London's most iconic buildings, is pictured shrouded in 'blood rain' earlier this month . In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm (pictured) that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude . Dr Steven Godby, a geographer researching the effects of blown sand and dust at Nottingham Trent University, explained how these events can occur. 'The dust is produced from source areas in North Africa, incorporated into a northerly airflow and can travel long distances before being deposited as far away as the UK. 'However, the events we experience are small scale compared to those experienced closer to major dust sources. And incredible pictures also taken at the beginning of April showed the moment ferocious red sandstorms  devoured a city in China's north west. China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance - the massive sandstorm that struck the north-west of the country being the fourth this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to The People's Daily Online. On April 1 a sandstorm could be seen enveloping much of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . By April 4, it was beginning to stretch across the Arabia Sea towards Pakistan and India . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) issued a blue alert for the sandstorms. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude. Clouds of dirt engulfed the town of Bedourie, in Queensland's south-west, bringing with it a thick, dusty night for more than 90 minutes. The Middle East has also experienced several huge sandstorms this year. This week Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran experienced severe dust storms and last week the Arabian Peninsula was hit by a sandstorm the size of the U.S. And in February raging sandstorms engulfed Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Egypt causing the worst Israeli air pollution in years and whipping up huge waves in the Mediterranean Sea. The sandstorm hit Egypt after unusually warm and sunny weather for a February day, and the sky over downtown Cairo turned yellow and blotted out the sun, limiting visibility . Hazy: The Egyptian capital was transformed by the sandstorm while Alexandria and nearby Dekheila ports were closed because of the weather . Red alert: The sandstorm in Egypt gave the country a Martian look . The storm, made up of accumulated dust carried from the far reaches of the Sahara Desert in North Africa also engulfed Cairo. Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry said air pollution levels were the country's worst in five years. The sandstorm that engulfed the Arabian Peninsula, meanwhile, wrecked havoc across the area, causing traffic accidents, the cancellation of hundreds of flights and triggering breathing difficulties among residents. Images showed the vast sandstorm sweeping its way across Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates and reaching as far east as India and Pakistan over a period of seven days. It began on April 1, when high winds whipped up the sandstorm in northern Saudi Arabia before it consolidated and began moving southeastward across the peninsula to eventually cover an area almost as large as the United States, Discover Magazine reported. Along the way it caused chaos across the area's major cities including Riyadh and Dubai, where some locations were reduced to zero visibility, streets turned a shade of orange and schools were forced shut. The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies said: 'The blowing sand reduced surface visibility to near zero at some locations, disrupting ground transportation, air traffic, and also closing schools. Dr Emilio Cuevas-Agulló, director of the Izana Atmospheric Research Center in Tenerife, Spain, told MailOnline that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally, population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them. He said: ‘We are more aware of the problem since we have much better monitoring, mainly from satellites, and forecast systems, in the last five to 10 years, and because the population growth and corresponding infrastructures increase in desert and arid regions, in recent decades, increasing vulnerability to the same dust episodes.’ He added: ‘Our longest dust records over the North Atlantic, downwind from the Sahara desert, which started in late 1970s show a great inter-annual variability and decadal changes, but we don't really see positive trends.’ Severely reduced viability caused traffic chaos in Egypt's capital city . 'Visibility was reduced to 0.1 mile for several hours at Dubai International Airport, which is one of the world’s busiest in terms of volume of flights.' More than 450 Saudi Arabian Airlines flights were cancelled between across three days which equalled 33 per cent of the carrier's 1,526 scheduled flights, the Saudi Gazette reported. On top of this, 678 flights were delayed and another 19 rerouted from airports in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam.

Prince Ali, a current FIFA vice-president from Jordan, said he could envisage a World Cup being played in different countries - or even in different confederations - in a similar way to Euro 2020 which is being played in 13 nations. In his manifesto, which he launched on Monday, Prince Ali has also warned against any decision on expanding the World Cup from its current 32 countries, or a re-allocation of places, being taken for purely political reasons to try to drum up votes for the FIFA presidency. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, a FIFA presidential candidate, wants to see the World Cup rotated between nations . Prince Ali, who aims to replace  Sepp Blatter (right), warned against expanding the World Cup from 32 teams . Prince Ali is standing for FIFA president alongside former Portugal and Real Madrid player Luis Figo . He is standing against current president Sepp Blatter, Michael van Praag from Holland and former Portugal international Luis Figo. In terms of World Cup rotation, Prince Ali said the confederations should take turns hosting the tournament. 'The principle is that it should be rotated among the confederations but it still has to be based on the best bids,' he said. 'But we have to be open-minded. I think it is also possible that two countries from different confederations could co-host the World Cup. Look at Europe in 2020 - a number of different regions or countries could host the World Cup - it's in the past now but potentially the Gulf could have had a World Cup due to its close proximity.' FIFA has announced it will make a decision on the allocation of World Cup places at an executive committee meeting the day after the presidential election on May 29. Prince Ali said much more consultation was needed before any decision should be made. He added: 'I am very hesitant about people playing politics with the most important flagship event of FIFA and possibly of sport in the world. 'We need to speak to all the stakeholders, including the sponsors. People are making promises to enlarge the World Cup but in 2022 they are making the World Cup shorter in terms of time frame. We cannot end up with a situation where mistakes are made again.' Prince Ali has also promised greater transparency, including making public the salary of the FIFA president and executive committee members. He also believes that the minutes of FIFA executive committee meetings should be made public. He also wants an investigation into how the US television rights for the 2026 World Cup were awarded to Fox without a tender process or any discussion with the FIFA executive committee. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke has said FIFA 'did what it had to do' to prevent any possible legal action from the broadcaster in relation to the 2022 rights after the Qatar World Cup was moved to the winter. Prince Ali, who insists there is a real appetite for change among FIFA associations, said large sums of money for football had potentially been lost. 'Unfortunately I was not made aware of it and I have been trying to find out what is going on,' he said. Michael van Praag (right), from Holland, is the remaining presidential candidate . 'Something went wrong and we need to get to the bottom of it. 'It needs to have a proper tendering process which is good practice in any organisation in the world. 'We are talking about a large sum of money that future generations will potentially have lost because of decisions or misadministration taking place at the moment by people who will probably not be around at that time.'","Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein launched his election manifesto on Monday .

I jump at the chance to experience new flavours and gather fresh inspiration. And where better to tickle your tastebuds than in glorious Grenada? The island is known for its zesty spices and self-sufficiency - the only food it imports is milk. Heading west: Rosemary spent a week on Grenada, where fresh foodstuffs like cocoa fruit are easily available . Meat and fish are plentiful and, because the soil is very fertile, the vegetables, fruit and salads are the glossiest you'll ever see. Grenada's seasons are similar to our own, which means cauliflower, broccoli and pumpkins in spring. Exotic fruit - mangoes, star fruit, passion fruit, melon and skin-up, which is like a lychee — are the stars of the summer. Autumn heralds guavas, sweetsop (sugar apples) and soursop (similar to pawpaw), and then there is the temptingly named mammee apple, which is a Caribbean version of a peach. Sumptuous sands: Grenada is home to splendid beaches - such as the glorious arc of Grand Anse . I am staying in the southwest of the island at Mount Cinnamon on Grand Anse Beach, near the charming town of St George. It offers well-equipped self-catering villas, each with its own terrace and wonderful views of the bay. You can cook your own supper, but the bubbling restaurant scene is difficult to resist. Beach bars abound. I especially liked the Beach Cabana at Mount Cinnamon, where they serve fabulously strong cocktails made with local rum at all hours of the day and night. People come across from nearby islands to enjoy the weekly bonfire on the beach, at which local musicians play. This is the Caribbean at its best. Just beware of those generous drinks measures. The restaurant Yolo (which is text speakfor 'you only live once') specialises in sushi and Asian cuisine. I order plums, mangoes, cherries and avocados, all picked that day. The fish is as fresh as can be - so the tuna tartare, its signature dish, almost leaps off the plate. Come dine with me: Grenada is an island awash with fresh produce and intriguing local recipes . The next day, I watch a fish cookery demonstration at Mount Cinnamon: a traditional dish of kingfish marinated in coconut, ginger, lime, spices, peppers and chives, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over a wood fire, and served with delicious breadfruit chips. If you want to mingle with Grenadans, there is nowhere better than a rambunctious food market. St George's market brims with local spices and everything else that is grown on the island. In a 17th-century working plantation - a colonial house and estate - you can witness the crops of fruit, exotic flowers and spices in their regimented glory. Here, I learn to cook the Grenadan national dish, oil down. This is a hearty, one-pot meal with salted meat, chicken, breadfruit, callaloo - which is like spinach - and dumplings. The whole lot is stewed in coconut milk. Delicious! The food odyssey continues in the evening when I visit BB's Crabback Caribbean restaurant, overlooking the harbour. My favourite place to eat on the beach is La Sagesse, on its own strip of sand from which you can swim in a bath-temperature sea. A place to cool your heels: Rosemary stayed at Grenada's elegant Mount Cinnamon resort . No tour of the island would be complete without a visit to the River Antione Rum Distillery - the last one in the Caribbean to make the drink from cane sugar, as they did in the 18th century. Rum is not to my taste, but it's interesting to see the process behind it. Belmont in the Grand Etang area is more to my liking. It's a fully functioning plantation and organic farm. We taste goat's cheese and salt fish fritters, a popular local dish. Even the governor grows her own vegetables. Her Excellency Dame Cecile la Grenade is the first woman governor on the island. She received an OBE from the Queen for the food business started by her mother. Her extensive gardens are full of exotic vegetables, fruit and spices — a dream to any aspiring cook. Even the paths are made of crushed nutmeg shells. A fitting tribute to this fragrant and friendly island. British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Grenada from £562 return.

388,d5e3add9f887075a83c369474811874d0abe37dc,"The family of one ANZAC veteran were thrilled to receive news from a stranger this week that their relative's war medal had been unearthed in an east Melbourne Park. Fossicker Ashley Manzie was combing the park with his metal detector when he discovered a medal belonging to Frederick George Biddulph, who served with the 23rd Australian Infantry Battalion at Gallipolli between 1914 and 1915. Mr Manzie posted photos of the silver medal to an online fossicking forum, which led him to Sydney man Stephen Norton - Biddulph's great-nephew. 'At first I thought it was a scam or someone trying to sell me something,' Mr Norton told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just couldn't believe it - I thought wow - and then I was really confused.' Rare find: Ashley Manzie unearthed the WW1 star medal when he was combing a Melbourne park with his metal detector last week. Mr Norton, who has been researching his family history for 'a very long time' says the discovery has raised more questions than it has answered. He thinks the inscribed medal doesn't belong to Frederick at all, but to his brother Lewis William Biddulph. 'Frederick never went to war. He'd lost two fingers blowing up fish so he  wouldn't have been accepted to fight,' said Mr Norton. 'We think his younger brother Lewis, who had a slight hearing problem, may have used his name to sign up.' It means that a grave in Melbourne's Springvale Cemetery bearing a plaque with Frederick's name is probably not his either. Instead, it records the date of Lewis's death, or 'Bunny' as he was called in the family 'because he was so fast.' Norton recently discovered that Frederick had actually died nine years before 'Bunny' in New Zealand. Frederick Biddulph's plaque at Melbourne's Springvale cemetery probably belongs to his brother Lewis, who joined the army in his name because he had poor hearing . Frederick Biddulph (left) pictured with Stephen Norton's grandfather, Thomas Driscoll, and another brother, Bill . Stephen Norton says tracing the family history has been difficult because it seems the men changed their names a number of times in order to get into the service. He says the only thing he knows for sure is that there were three brothers who went off to WW1 from Tasmania - and that they all came back alive. The other brothers were Benjamin William, who was awarded the Gallipoli Medal, and David Tasman. According to national records, the 23rd Battalion with which Bunny served landed at Anzac cove in September 1914. The troops manned Lone Pine, 'one of the most trying parts of the Anzac frontline' until they left Gallipoli in December 1915. Norton says his own grandfather - Bunny's brother - fought in the Battle of Fromelles in France. 'He was a machine-gunner who was caught on the wire and spent years as a Prisoner of War in Germany before making it back to Australia,' Norton says. 'Somehow they all made it home.' From the archives: Frederick (left) whose name is inscribed on the WW1 medal, never joined the army because he lost two fingers 'blowing up fish' before the war. The lost medal is instead thought to have belonged to his brother, Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says it made his year to be able to return the medal to a living relative ahead of  the ANZAC Day Centenary this weekend . Some of Manzie's other finds with the silver war medal . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says he was 'blown away' to unearth the medal so close to the 100 year ANZAC Day anniversary. He says he found Stephen Norton after 'researching his heart out' with other members of the Australian Metal Detecting and Relic Hunting online forum. 'Definitely a roamer,' he posted to the forum after finding a slew of documents on Frederick Biddulph in the National archives. 'I found out that he was discharged from the Army as medically unfit when he returned to Australia in 1917, that he was diagnosed with Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart),' Manzie told Daily Mail Australia. Manzie also found letters from Biddulph's mother in Tasmania, appealing to the authorities for information about her son. 'Not knowing he whereabouts:' Ashley Manzie discovered this letter from Frederick Biddulph's mother asking the authorities for information on the whereabouts of her son . Did Mrs Biddulph ever make contact with her son Frederick or was she looking for Bunny? 'I don't know, I don't know if she even knew about the name swaps,' says Stephen Norton. 'Dad's the only one from that era who would know - and I was hoping to be able to drag more out of him - but he's 94 now and his memory isn't what it was.' For Norton, the discovery raises the question of the other two medals that the records say were awarded to 'Frederick'. 'This is the only one that has come to light, maybe the others are with his family, I don't even know if he had children and if there's other family out there,' he says. Stephen Norton doesn't know whether Private Frederick George Biddulph's mother ever made contact with her son, or his brother Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph, when they returned to Australia from the war . Stephen Norton says he will proudly wear the newly-found medal, alonsgide those of his grandfather and his own father, to the Marylands RSL Anzac Day dawn service this weekend. Ashley Manzie says the discovery has 'made his year.' 'It made not just my day but my year when I found out that I could return the medal to a living relative. Especially being the 100 year anniversary of ANZAC,' he said. 'All this history and amazing story all from a beep on my detector in a park! Lest we forget.'","A Melbourne man has unearthed a WW1 medal  with his metal detector .

391,43714dad35c2ec64d16ef6bdd17853a2f5eb0744,"A bizarre new dinosaur with bat-like wings has been discovered by a farmer in China and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight. Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago. The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat’s wing. Scroll down for video . The new dinosaur, named Yi qi (shown above in the artists reconstruction), had unusual bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings that were covered in a membrane. The dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap . Scientists believe the dinosaur, which they have named Yi qi, meaning ‘strange wing’, may have glided or even flown through the air. The discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air. A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows  a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, and Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . Researchers say the dinosaur, which would have weighted just 13 ounces (380g) and was 33cm (12 inches) long with a wings that spanned 60cm (23 inches), may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight. Yi qi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes Tyranosaurus rex and velociraptor. These dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds. But unlike modern birds, Yi qi was found to have a strange extra  bone extending backwards from its wrist, rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats. Professor Xing Xu, one of the world’s leading prolific palaeontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and who led the work, said: 'This is really something for me. It is the most unexpected discovery I ever made. 'Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear. This new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs. 'This dinosaur is totally different. It has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives. 'Close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded. 'I would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition.' The discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex. The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China. The fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings. However, it was the strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists. There are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus, and the bats, which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds. However, Yi qi, which is pronounced 'ee chee', appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat. This suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly. The fossil of Yi qi (above) was so well preserved that bristle-like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones. The strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual . This close up of the skull of Yi qi, which weighed just 13 ounces (380g), show oval like feathers near the head . Analysis by Professor Xu and his colleagues, which is published in the journal Nature, suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided, perhaps like modern flying squirrels. The dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight. Instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground. If it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances. But Professor Xu said: 'We thought giving this animal a name meaning ""strange wing"" was appropriate, because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind . 'We don’t know if Yi qi was flapping, or gliding, or both, but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds.' It is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists, but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors. Professor Zheng Xiaoting, from Linyi University in Shandong who also took part in the study, said: 'Yi qi lived in the Jurassic, so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds. 'It reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations, not all of which survived.' Dr Kevin Padian, a palaeontologist at the University of California Berkeley, warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all. The fossil of Yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in Mutoudeng in Qinglong County in China . The diagrams above show how  the wing of Yi qi (a) compares to other winged tetrapods (b and c) and the wing of a bat (d), the wing of a pigeon (e), the wing of a pterosaur (f) and the wing of a Japanese flying squirrel (g) He said: ‘As for gliding, if Yi qi’s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil, it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing, as Xu and colleagues have done. ‘But in a gliding animal, the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body — if the bulk of the animal’s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift, the back end will sag and the animal will stall. ‘That is clearly the case in the authors’ reconstruction of Yi qi, but an aerofoil that was swept back more, if anatomically possible, might have mitigated this problem. ‘Still, we are left in a quandary: an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight, borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies. ‘And so far, there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure.’","Yi qi is thought to have lived 160 million years ago during the late Jurassic .

A source, whose children were born at the hospital’s exclusive Lindo Wing, told Daily Telegraph reporter Gordon Rayner: ‘The doctors don’t normally wait for more than a week. ‘They will probably already have been in touch with Kate, and talked about which day which suit her best to go in and be induced if the baby doesn’t arrive in the next couple of days.’ A Kensington Palace source said last week: 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date.'  Prince George was reportedly born three days late when he arrived at the hospital in July 2013.

All I hope and pray for is there'll be happy, healthy news for that wonderful couple and for the whole country.’ Around one in five deliveries in the UK is assisted.

Subs not used: Guerra, Ochoa, Torres, Filipenko . Booked: Sanchez, Damian Tissone . Goals: Juanmi 71' After just four minutes, Bale's game was over. The Welshman tenderly touched his calf and made a pulling motion with his hands to the bench as he left the pitch, which might imply internal muscle damage. Given that Karim Benzema was injured after a brutal Champions League encounter with City rivals Atletico Madrid in midweek, Bale's injury took the famous ""BBC"" strikeforce just down to C. That's the grade you'd give it too, in 2015, when compared to the performances of Barcelona's trio. Isco came in for Benzema, with the Frenchman's injury solving a problem that was brewing at Real Madrid, with Carlo Ancelotti having to choose between the former Malaga man, and James Rodriguez. The latter was chosen over the former to face Atletico, leading to stories of angst on Isco's part, but the issue was resolved by Benzema's timely absence. Modric, meanwhile, was taken out by a Recio challenge in the second half. It wasn't too fierce a tackle, but the Croatian took a strong knock to his knee and is now a doubt for Wednesday's second leg against Atletico. Malaga, having beaten Barcelona at Camp Nou earlier this season, and drawn with champions Atletico Madrid last week, are no La Liga whipping boys and they came to the Santiago Bernabeu with the belief they could win. Nordin Amrabat, on loan from Galatasaray, charged forward battling with Pepe, escaped the Real Madrid defender and crossed for Juanmi, but the forward couldn't connect and the chance was gone. The Dutchman stung Iker Casillas' fingertips with a strike from distance, the veteran stopper tipping his effort behind for a corner. Carlos Idriss Kameni was forced into a similar save at the other end, spectacularly flicking a header from Bale's replacement, Javier Hernandez, over the bar.

Real Madrid broke the deadlock in controversial fashion, when Ronaldo fired in a free kick from the left and Ramos rammed home from close range. The defender seemed fractionally offside, but despite Kameni's cries, the goal was allowed to stand. The Cameroonian goalkeeper was called into action again shortly afterwards, making a fine save down to his right from a James volley. With the most expensive player in the world off the pitch, the second most expensive was having fun. Ronaldo pulled off a quite ridiculous backheel-nutmeg on Marcos Angeleri. In the following minute Ramos had the ball in the net again, nodding home a Toni Kroos free-kick, but this time the officials spotted he was offside and ruled it out. Malaga flew down the other end and created a magnificent opportunity, which Sergi Darder blazed over the bar when he should have found the net. Juanmi's cross was half-cleared by Marcelo and Darder pounced, but lacked balance and spooned his strike off-target from eight yards. Amrabat, flying down the right early in the second half, tried to find Juanmi with a low cross, but it flew past the forward and Casillas gathered it. Ronaldo had the perfect opportunity to put the game beyond Malaga when James was taken down in the box by Samu Castillejo, but lacked his characteristic cool and fired the penalty against the left upright.

But Real Madrid didn't have long to wait for their second, with James scoring in spectacular fashion just a minute later. He played two one-twos on the edge of the box with Isco and Ronaldo, before lashing the ball into Kameni's top right corner. Game over? Not quite. Malaga were straight down the other end and on the scoresheet, with Roberto Rosales whipping the ball in from the right for Juanmi to head home. Amrabat had a chance to run through after a Marcelo mis-step - this was a rare poor performance for the Brazilian - but Kroos resorted to a blatant kick to stop him. The German went into the book, with the foul a symbol of how Madrid were struggling to prevent the Andalusian side from getting forward on the break.

Ronaldo's evening was saved on a personal level at the end, with Hernandez selflessly squaring the ball for the forward to tap home at the far post. His celebration was excessive, considering Madrid had essentially won the game and it was a simple finish, but that's what happens when you have to keep up with the Joneses. Or in this case, the Messis. The Argentine had scored for Barcelona earlier, so Ronaldo would have left frustrated had he not been able to replicate Messi's effort, grabbing his 39th goal of the season in La Liga, and his 50th in all competitions. Ronaldo became the first ever player to net 50 goals in five consecutive seasons, an incredible statistic, but Ancelotti's mind will now turn to Wednesday night and another incredible statistic. He has faced Atletico Madrid seven times so far this season and not won a single game.

But this isn't the real Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Instead, it's their puppet likenesses - commissioned for ITV's new comedy spoof show, Newzoids. And the Duke and Duchess aren't the only royals to get a puppet makeover. Their dolls will be joined by an even more amusing version of Prince Harry, as well as a roster of celebrities. Scroll down for video . Plastic princess: The Duchess of Cambridge is about to make her debut in puppet form . The show, which has been likened to 1980s behemoth Spitting Image, starts later this month and, according to makers Citrus TV, will offer a similarly light-hearted take on current affairs. Sketches set to feature in the opening show include one that sees David Cameron slug it out with Nick Clegg on a puppet version of The Jeremy Kyle Show. Another sketch will see Ed Miliband's effigy join Ant and Dec to star in a show called 'I'm a Catastrophe... Get Me Out of Here' while a third will see Professor Brian Cox unearthing a new planet - on Kim Kardashian's backside. The six-part series will also feature Wayne Rooney, Beyonce, Harry Styles and The Great British Bake Off's Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry. Star of the show: Prince William's puppet is ready for the launch of new series, Newzoids . The real thing: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Stephen Lawrence Centre in south London . Royal stars: The Duke and Duchess will appear alongside Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall . The new show represents the first time that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have found themselves lampooned in a comedy show. But while it will all be new to William and Kate, other members of the Royal Family will remember their starring roles in Spitting Image. Among the most memorable was the jug-eared puppet of Prince Charles, who was famously shown talking on a telephone made of roses. Charles will return to puppet form in Newzoids, this time reimagined as a version of Gogglebox's Dominic Parker. The Duchess of Cornwall will be shown as a take on Steph, with the royal couple set to chortle and booze their way through a Gogglebox-style sketch. Entertainer: Prince Harry will also feature in the ITV show - albeit in puppet form . The Great British Fake Off: Stars Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry also feature in Newzoids . Speaking about the new show, Elaine Bedell, Director of Entertainment and Comedy for ITV, said: 'ITV has a rich history of playing popular satirical comedy in peaktime on its main channel, and it seemed a good time to revive it this year. 'We are pleased to be adding to our growing comedy portfolio with this funny and biting look at the world of politics and celebrity.' The show, which will be filmed by animation specialists Factory, will be voiced by a cast that includes impressionist Debra Stephenson and will be produced by Giles Pilbrow and Dominic Brigstocke who boast Have I Got News For You and Alan Partridge among their credits.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been turned into puppets .

397,21f0e99078680942ff19539244218ceaa4e39775,"Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League all season and on Saturday he demonstrated just how much he has grown as a player and how important he has been to Chelsea’s imminent title victory. He is now the player you look to in a crisis. He is the man who has been eking out wins when the team hasn’t been at its best. He did it last week at Queens Park Rangers, winning the ball from the goalkeeper’s kick and driving into the box to set up Cesc Fabregas, and he did it on Saturday with his finish. He’s dragging them over the line at the minute. You wondered when Jose Mourinho came in whether Hazard would be the kind of player who would work hard enough for him. And he would have taken the hint when he saw Juan Mata moved out that there would be no special favours from the manager for his creative players. Eden Hazard fires past David De Gea following a storming run from the Belgian star into the box . Hazard celebrates in front of the Stamford Bridge faithful following his 38th minute strike . The Chelsea forward's first-half strike proved crucial as the Blues eked out a 1-0 victory . He perhaps looked at that and responded. You will see in certain games against lesser teams he might have a licence not to track back — but not today, not against the best teams. Then he is required to do the requisite defensive work. And he does now. But the big change for him in the last 18 months has been in his finishing — and that was evident again on Saturday. He’s now on 17 goals for the season. He’s always been a player who could assist and create but now you look to him for goals. He is the danger man, he draws people to him and creates space for the rest of the team. He’s not in the top three players in the world at the moment but he’s creeping ever closer. What he will need to reach that level is for Chelsea to make a Champions League final and for him to be decisive. Hazard tries to guide a deflected shot into the United goal as Ander Herrera tries to snuff out the danger . He is improving every season, which is a good sign, and if he keeps doing that he has a chance of being that good. Chelsea will win the league now. I don’t think they’re at their best at the moment but managing a league campaign is not about playing well all the time. It’s about surviving the difficult periods — and Chelsea haven’t lost games when they’ve struggled in the same way that Manchester City or Manchester United did. Now they look a little tired as they get towards the finishing line and Mourinho would feel he has very strong squad of 13 and 14 but he will probably try to bring in people so he can give Nemanja Matic or Cesc Fabregas a couple of weeks rest at times to recuperate. As for United, for all their dominance in possession, they lacked enough clear-cut chances. In fact they needed something like the magic of Oscar’s back-heel and Hazard’s finish. Louis van Gaal will have been pleased that they controlled long periods of the game with their passing but they did lack that bit of punch. Wayne Rooney takes on Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Hazard at Stamford Bridge . With Wayne Rooney not being able to play at centre forward because of the injuries, it did neuter them somewhat. I thought he did well in midfield and proved that he can drop back into that position — his passing and play was excellent. But he’s been the thrust of the team in recent times. Maybe two years ago Radamel Falcao or Robin van Persie could have provided that, but at the moment United need Rooney to give them that impetus in the really difficult games. When Sir Alex Ferguson left, you would have said it might take a couple of seasons to establish a new identity and build a new foundation. It’s been a bumpy ride and they wouldn’t have expected another change of manager, but at least, two years on, it looks as though they are now in that place. Jose Mourinho may look to give key players such as Fabregas (right) a rest in the coming weeks .","Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League all season .

Not what I ordered: Toni Elliot, 53, (right) found her meal had extra crunch this week when she found 50 pearls inside the baked oyster she was feasting on at Puckett's Boat House in Franklin, Tennessee . As naturally-occurring pearls are rare, it's expected that Elliot's stash could fetch a princely sum. Eric Horton, who was serving Elliot at the time, said he couldn't believe what he saw happening. He swiftly grabbed a container to collect the pearls up from Eliot's dinner plate. Recalling the incident, he told WSMV News: 'It happens sometimes, every once in a while. 'However, this young lady continued to pull pearls out of her mouth, and the only thing we were missing was a string because she found 50 pearls in this one oyster.'

It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.'

Prosecutors have said Robert Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across an Interstate 89 median and smashed into an SUV carrying 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was 8 months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Relatives of Murphy and Timmons tore into Dellinger during the first of the two-day sentencing hearing. Amanda Murphy's mother, Tammy Langlois, and Murphy's sister, Ashley Murphy, cry after speaking about the moment they learned of the accident that killed Murphy, her unborn child, and her fiancee, Jason Timmons, during Robert Dellinger's sentencing  on Wednesday . Defense attorney Lucy Karl comforts Robert Dellinger after testimony by the families of Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons. The former Fortune 500 executive has admitted causing a highway crash that killed them and their unborn fetus . 'I have been robbed and violated. I will never see or touch my child ever again,' Timmons' mother, Debbie Blanchard, said as she fought back tears. 'How could you be so heartless? You still have a family; you have taken mine from me', reports the Valley News of West Lebanon. Dellinger appeared to be deeply remorseful during the hearing, the newspaper reported. 'You have my deepest, most heartfelt apology, condolences and remorse for your loss. I am so sorry,' the 54-year-old Dellinger said through sobs. 'My guilt and remorse will be with me forever. I ask for your forgiveness, and I pray for your healing.' Dellinger, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was a senior vice president and chief financial officer at PPG Industries Inc. when he left in 2011 because of health problems. He also held high-level posts at Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co. Earlier he had  told the court he has 'never been suicidal.' Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013 . Pregnant: This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . He pleaded guilty in February to negligent homicide for the deaths of the couple, who were from Wilder, Vermont, and to assault for the death of the fetus.

During Wednesday's hearing, Dellinger's wife, Deborah, called him a man of 'ethics, integrity and friendship,' the Valley News reported. 'We are devastated by the deaths of your loved ones,' she said as her husband broke down at the defense table. 'We have been and continue to pray every day for your collective peace and comfort.' Dellinger reportedly broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of Murphy and Timmons. Defense lawyers have said Dellinger was suffering from delirium due to a 'toxic regime' of prescription medications for multiple sclerosis and depression. In asking for a shorter sentence, they also contend he was suffering from withdrawal of a sleeping aid. Robert Dellinger thanks his family and friends for their support in court on Wednesday. He told a judge that he wasn't suicidal at the time of the crash . Attorney Steven Gordon wrote in a sentencing brief they now know 'a medical event' was the main cause 'of this accident.' Dellinger has been jailed since his arrest in December. His lawyers want a sentence that would see him serve only about eight months in prison after being given credit for time already served. Investigators say Dellinger told them that on the day of the accident he 'had a disagreement with his wife and went to Vermont to drive around. He said he was very depressed and gloomy and wanted to have a car wreck and kill himself.' On Wednesday, Dellinger told the court: 'I have never been suicidal.' Assistant Attorney General Geoffrey Ward said in court that Dellinger's truck reached 101 mph in the seconds before the crash and was going 87 mph one second before he hit the SUV. His truck sheared off the top of the SUV. The medical examiner's report compared the injuries suffered by Murphy and Timmons to those of plane crash victims. Dellinger suffered cuts and bruises.

According to the prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his . medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported.

Discussing how different women's bodies react during pregnancy, Dr Venkat, Director at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'If a woman is healthy - physically and mentally - to start with and if she looks after herself well then she will look radiant. 'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.' Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman. When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy. Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established.

However a cell phone video of the incident was recorded and upwards of 50 witnesses were in the bar. No charges have been filed. According to The Washington Post, a university press release announced the termination Thursday morning. 'Jans was terminated following an investigation into his recent public conduct,' the statement read. 'The University concluded that Jans' public conduct failed to meet his obligations as a head coach and the expectations that BGSU Athletics has for its coaches.' Jans leaves the school after a single season, taking the team to its first postseason victory in 40 years. His final record there stands at 21-12. He was formerly an assistant at Wichita State before he signed with Bowling Green.

April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and Autism Assistance Dogs are a little known but hugely beneficial form of 'animal therapy'. It turns out man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism who may otherwise struggle to talk, communicate, walk or socialise. An 'Autism Assistance Dog' is used to keep a child with autism safe and are an incredible tool to help them develop social skills and positive relationships. The term 'Autism Spectrum Disorders' (ASD) is an umbrella term that includes Autistic disorder; Asperger's and Atypical Autism. April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and people may be oblivious that man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism (stock picture) Children with autism often have difficulty with social interactions and their verbal and non-verbal communication skills may be badly affected. They can struggle to cope with change and unfamiliar environments and routines. 'The Autism Assistance Dog (AAD) Program is designed to improve the quality of life for both the child with autism and his or her family through three key areas: safety, independence and inclusion,' according to GuideDogs SA. Every child is unique meaning matching the right dog to their need's and their family is crucial. The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household. It has been reported by families participating in the Austism Assistance Dog Program that the companion can also foster positive interactions between siblings, encouraging play. The highly trained, specialised working dogs are licenced to accompany the child in essentially any location. 'An Austism Assistance Dog (AAD) has the same legal rights of access as a Guide or Hearing Dog. It is clearly identified by a coat which has securing points and a handle that the child can hold if appropriate or required,' according to GuideDogs SA. 'The purpose of the coat is to bring awareness to the special circumstances regarding the dog. This also increases the ease of access to public places by differentiating the status of an AAD from that of a pet.' The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household (stock picture) It can make family outings or even a quick trip to the shops possible where a child with autism may have struggled before. It can also give parents peace of mind as they know their child is being looked out for by a dog which has been specially trained to help their master avoid harm's way. The comfort of having their furry pooch by their side can offer a sense of stability for the child and be a calming presence on all members of the family. Children with autism 'have a high tendency to 'bolt' when they feel anxious or stressed. This is made even more alarming as they are often far less aware of danger and may not respond to direction. This can be a great challenge, requiring constant observance from their carer to ensure the child remains safe. 'On outings, the child's safety is enhanced by being connected to a coat on the dog's body, through a safety belt around the child's waist,' explained Guide Dogs SA. 'The parent has control of the dog through their own lead and will apply vocal commands to the dog. The child is encouraged to walk beside the dog but if they do choose to run off on their own, the dog is specially trained to quickly and calmly take control of the situation. 'The dog is trained to resist by sitting or lying down, acting as an ""anchor"",' GuideDogs SA explains. 'This gives the parent time to intervene and diffuse the situation.' However, the importance of this lesson is that, through the repetition, children's attempts to bolt are often reduced or completely eradicated. 'These dogs are a friend when you need one any hour of the day, every day of the year. 'They are also skilled for a few select tasks if you happen to need a hand… or a paw!'","Assistance Dogs are a little known but crucial tool for children with autism .

The gang broke into an aviary and bundled 200 of the animals into sacks and containers around 3.30am on January 12. CCTV showed the men took the birds to a tower block in Walsall, West Midlands, and dumped them on the floor before kicking them and forcing them out of barely open windows. Four teenagers have been caught on camera kicking a rare bird, thought to be in the bag above, and throwing another out of a window in Walsall, West Midlands, on January 12 . The birds were also jammed into drawers, squeezed to death and even chased by a dog, Walsall Magistrates Court heard. One resident reported that a dead bird was posted through his letterbox while others were dropped through windows. Three men and a youth have been convicted of their involvement and will be sentenced next month. Chad Worgan, from Walsall, admitted an offence of receiving stolen goods and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal on the basis that he kicked a pigeon. The 19-year-old knew the animals were in the bags and had a 'sick grin across his face' as he appearing to grab one of the perched birds and visibly squeeze it, the court heard. Thomas Knox, from Bloxwich, denied the same charges. A dog belonging to Knox, also 19, was let into the flat to terrorise the birds, it was revealed. Jake Higgs, 23, from Bloxwich, admitted receiving stolen goods but denied causing unnecessary suffering. A 16-year-old from Erdington, Birmingham, also attended but cannot be named for legal reasons. The birds were also jammed into drawers, shoved through barely open windows (above), squeezed to death and even chased by a dog, Walsall Magistrates Court heard . All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. One of the men (above) can be seen with a grin on his face during the attack . All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. Bob Thomas, chairman of the bench, said their actions amounted to 'joint enterprise'. He added: 'They arrive with a dog and are seen to be carrying a variety of bags and containers. These are emptied by them and both a large number of dead and live birds are seen. 'The CCTV shows all of them entering the property together and all playing some part in the birds' suffering. 'We are satisfied that they were all aware of the contents of the bags.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'The birds were stolen from an aviary in the Brownhills area in the early hours of January 12. 'They were then taken to Dolphin House where they were emptied onto the landing area of the block.' The birds were stolen from rare bird breeder Lee Williams who had built up his collection of rare jays, finches, doves, budgerigars, quails and pigeons over a number of years. In 2008, the dad-of-two considered giving up his passion after 270 animals worth £4,000 were stolen. Speaking at the time, his wife Michelle said: 'This has devastated him.

406,31171fd8e19677f021b50a335e490e3fb4680371,"Israel's leader reacted furiously to the West’s nuclear deal with Iran yesterday, warning that it would threaten his country’s very survival. Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran’s agreement to reduce some of its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions would pave the way for Tehran to build an atomic bomb. In Iran yesterday, thousands danced in the streets to celebrate the landmark accord which could finally result in the easing of economic restrictions that have caused the price of essentials to soar and businesses to go bust. Danger: Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal will 'increase Iran's aggression and terror throughout the Middle-East' But Israel, which fears an Iranian nuclear attack, issued a series of dire warnings. Mr Netanyahu insisted that he and his Cabinet were united in ‘strongly opposing’ an agreement. ‘This deal would legitimise Iran’s nuclear programme, bolster Iran’s economy and increase Iran’s aggression and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond,’ the prime minister said. ‘It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war.’ Other critics including Saudi Arabia and Republicans in the US say the deal leaves scope for Iran to cheat. Barack Obama, however, has hailed the agreement struck after tortuous negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland, as a ‘historic understanding’. There are still many details to be thrashed out before the deal is due to be signed on June 30, including the pace at which sanctions will be lifted and what happens if Iran is found to have breached the terms. But Mr Netanyahu told President Obama in a phone call yesterday that the existing framework ‘would threaten the survival of Israel’. According to tweets from his spokesman Mark Regev, Mr Netanyahu said: ‘The deal would not shut down a single nuclear facility in Iran. The deal would legitimise Iran’s illegal nuclear programme. ‘The alternative is standing firm and increasing the pressure on Iran until a better deal is achieved.’ Historic understanding: President Barack Obama hailed the nuclear agreement between Iran and U.S. while critics issued stark warnings . Mr Netanyahu is demanding that any final agreement must involve Iran’s recognition of Israel’s right to exist. President Hassan Rouhani has pledged that Iran will abide by its commitments in the nuclear agreement, which ends a standoff between Western powers and Iran lasting several years. Countries involved in the so-called P5+1 talks are the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany. Under the proposed terms, Iran must reduce the number of its centrifuges, the equipment used to enrich uranium into nuclear fuel, by two thirds, and can only enrich it enough to use for domestic power generation, not weapons. The deal also means that for the first time the Iranians will agree to have their nuclear plants inspected. And a major nuclear plant at Fordow will have to become a research lab, although one at Natanz can still carry out enrichment. Mr Obama said yesterday: ‘This will be a long-term deal, that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb. If Iran cheats, the world will know about it.’ He said that if the deal is finalised, ‘we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully’. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted his country was not surrendering and stood to gain from the deal. After arriving home, he issued a statement saying: ‘We have serious goals in the negotiations and eventually, based on what we have achieved so far, we believe we can reach them.’","Lifting sanctions could pave the way for Iran to build atomic bomb .

Mirko Filipovic (right) faces Gabriel Gonzaga in Poland on Saturday, eight years after losing to the Brazilian . In 2007, Filipovic (right) was beaten by a first-round head kick and wants to avenge that defeat . Filipovic admitted revenge is a motivating factor ahead of the encounter against Gonzaga . ‘I want to beat all the opponents who have beaten me before,’ Cro Crop said. ‘But especially this fight because I lost to him and this time I feel better motivated and more prepared than I did last time. ‘He [Gonzaga] is a big guy. He is tough - he always goes for the victory and sometimes he is successful, sometimes he is less successful. But he definitely is a tough opponent for everyone. ‘I don’t want to think too far ahead - I am focusing on this fight and whatever is next, will happen. ‘I am in really great shape. My training is great - I keep the same schedule of training and I am prepared and ready for this fight. ‘I have been training with Stipe [Miocic] - he is a really great guy. We have been training really hard to prepare for both of our fights. He is just a great guy to train with and to be around. ‘All of the people I have lost against, I always want to fight again. UFC decided it would be Gonzaga and yes I wanted this rematch very much.’ Gonzaga, meanwhile, insists he does not view the fight as a rematch, given the eight-year wait. ‘I didn’t make any mistakes [in his last fight against Cro Cop] and he did make one, and I tried to capitalise on that,’ he said. ‘Eight years can change a lot. So much can change in that time so I do not consider this a rematch; I consider this a new fight. ‘I’ve got better in that time - my skill set has got better. ‘I’m going to try to avoid his high kick. But I will be ready wherever the fight goes. Gonzaga said he does not consider the fight with Filipovic a rematch because of the gap of eight years . Gonzaga believes that his skillset has got even better since the last time he took on Filipovic . ‘That’s the thing about the heavyweight division in the UFC, you know, one punch can change everything. ‘I believe people are never going to forget our first fight. But right now I just need to win this fight. ‘I always need to keep working towards the title shot.

410,9c30e92840e19d7f495d59c05e6fbeb097fc27a5,"Bird numbers have dramatically declined in Fukushima, research has revealed. Scientists analysed 57 species in the region and found that the majority of populations had diminished as a result of the nuclear accident. They found that one breed in particular had plummeted from several hundred before the 2011 disaster to just a few dozen today. Researchers have found that bird species are continuing to drop in Fukushima (shown after the disaster in 2011). The barn swallow, for example, dropped from hundreds to dozens. This is despite radiation levels in the region starting to fall. And comparing it to Chernobyl could reveal what the future holds . The research, published in the Journal of Ornithology, was carried out by scientists at the University of South Carolina including biologist Dr Tim Mousseau. They showed that the situation has steadily worsened since the disaster on 11 March 2011. On that day, just over four years ago, Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was heavily damaged by an earthquake and its resultant tsunami. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. This led to three of the plant’s six nuclear reactors going into meltdown and releasing radioactive materials. Reports claim the soil and water in the region still contains high levels of radiation which makes the clean-up effort difficult. A total of 300,000 people evacuated the Fukushima area on the east coast and 15,884 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami. Many populations were found to have diminished in number as a result of the accident, with several species suffering dramatic declines. One of the most hard-hit species is the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure. ‘We know that there were hundreds in a given area before the disaster, and just a couple of years later we're only able to find a few dozen left,’ said Dr Mousseau. ‘The declines have been really dramatic.’ And while background radiation has declined in the region in recent years, the negative effects of the accident on birds are actually increasing. ‘The relationship between radiation and numbers started off negative the first summer, but the strength of the relationship has actually increased each year,’ Dr Mousseau said. ‘So now we see this really striking drop-off in numbers of birds as well as numbers of species of birds. ‘So both the biodiversity and the abundance are showing dramatic impacts in these areas with higher radiation levels, even as the levels are declining.’ Dr Tim Mousseau and his team made the findings using thermoluminescent detectors, which use gamma-radiation-sensitive crystals (shown) to measure radiation doses in individual subjects living in the wild . One hard-hit species was the barn swallow (stock image shown), Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure . The team are hoping to get information on what the future holds for Fukushima from the Chernobyl site, which was the scene of a devastating release of radioactive materials in Ukraine in 1986. One difference noticed so far is that migratory birds fared worse in Chernobyl, whereas it was year-round residents that were doing worse at Fukushima. This could be due to differences in DNA repair capabilities for migratory species as a result of flapping their wings - which lowers their antioxidant levels and makes them more vulnerable to radiation. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. Shown are radiation levels immediately after the accident in 2011 .","Researchers find that bird species are continuing to drop in Fukushima .

Norfolk Police continued to look for Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, who has been missing since March 2, and focused on a pond near Carrsville after a new tip. Local resident Steve Hines said that divers were searching the outer edges of the pond for the Longwood University freshman's phone, which sent strange text messages to her mother shortly after her disappearance. Scroll down for video . Police are searching a pond near Carrsville, Virginia, in an attempt to find the cell phone of Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, a Longwood University freshman who was last seen on March 2. AJ Hadsell (left) was last seen driving near her parents' home in Norfolk and her stepfather Wesley Hadsell (right) was taken into custody late last month after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours . The teenager was last seen when she was home for spring break driving near her home in Norfolk, roughly 40 miles from the pond searched Friday, according to 13 News Now. Hines said that police showed him a picture and asked him if he had seen a white van for Quality Plumbing. He said that he had seen the vehicle, which belongs to a company where Hadsell's stepfather Wesley works, driving along the rural road. He had been working in nearby Franklin, Virginia, around the time of the disappearance. The stepfather of the teenager, 36, was taken into police custody late last month amid claims that he knows who has taken his daughter. He was arrested on March 21 after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours. Wesley was been locked up on six charges including four charges of obstructing justice, one charge of possessing ammunition after a felony and one charge of breaking and entering. He said he broke into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter against her will. Wesley Hadsell, left, has admitted breaking into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter AJ, right, against her will. The stepfather has a criminal record including dropped rape and kidnapping charges . Residents of Carrsville reported a white plumbing van for the company Wesley Hadsell works for driving suspiciously around the pond . 'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com. Wesley has admitted to spending roughly 18 minutes inside the home, where he says he searched for evidence by going through the trash and searching under the carpet. He said he even punched the family dog out of anger. While searching the property AJ's stepfather claims that he discovered her jacket. 'I found my daughter's jacket in his couch rolled up behind the cushion,' he said. 'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light. It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.' Officially police have said that they are not ruling out foul play and they have no suspects. During a search of Wesley's hotel room police found 72 rounds of nine-millimeter ammunition. He has aroused local suspicions on social media in part because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. In 2005 his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states. Charges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped. Police have not ruled out foul play in the disappearance of the Longwood University freshman, which has lasted for more than a month . Police spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road late last month . He also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR. Now he says that he is a changed man. Wesley and his wife were estranged when he was arrested, but it is not clear what their relationship was at the time of the disappearance. Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received text messages from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not sure that the person sending them was actually the missing girl. Wesley Hadsell was denied bond and the judge said the he was trying to impede the investigation into his stepdaughter's disappearance, according to the Virginian-Pilot. He admitted to increasing cocaine use, but said that he just wants to see his daughter home. A neighbor reported seeing AJ driving 'with purpose' and then saw a white four-door vehicle following about a minute behind her. They say Hadsell was followed by a white four-door compact car less than one minute later, and that another neighbor spotted a similar white car in the family's driveway around the same time. AJ's family and friends discovered items of her clothing two weeks ago near the side of the road in a remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake. Four items were found that belonged to her. AJ is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds.","Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, has been missing since March 2 .

The cardboard gnome featured alongside a host of celebrities and historic figures including actress Diana Dors, singer Bob Dylan and actor Marlon Brando on the psychedelic cover of the ground-breaking 1967 album. In total more than 60 celebrities appear on the famous cover including the Fab Four themselves - but because it would have been impossible to get all of them in a room together, waxworks and cardboard cutouts were used instead. The cardboard gnome featured alongside a host of celebrities and historic figures including actress Diana Dors, singer Bob Dylan and actor Marlon Brando on the psychedelic cover of the ground-breaking 1967 album . The knee-high little gnome, circled, appeared next to George Harrison's left leg on the famous album cover . Other well-known figures include writer Edgar Allen Poe, dancer Fred Astaire, comedians Laurel and Hardy and boxer Sonny Liston, poet Dylan Thomas and philosopher Karl Marx. The album cover was the brainchild of artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth and photographer Michael Cooper, who constructed and shot it it on March 30, 1967. John Lennon had wanted models of Jesus and Adolf Hitler to be included but his requests were denied. The album cover ended up being so extravagant that the final cost of producing the artwork was £3,000 - a whopping £50,000 in today's money. Following the shoot Mr Cooper's photography assistant was given the 20-inch tall cardboard gnome as a souvenir by The Beatles, who each signed it. The front and back of the gnome were then mounted alongside an unopened copy of the Sgt Pepper's vinyl LP. The cardboard gnome actually came in two parts and was pinned together for the cover. Gifted to a photography assistant it was signed by all for members of the band following the shoot . It emerged for sale almost 50 years after the album was released after it was listed for auction by a private collector. Experts at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, had given the gnome a pre-sale estimate of $25,000 - around £17,000 - but it ended up going to an unnamed buyer for $42,500 - or £29,000. Dean Harmeyer, from Heritage Auctions, said: 'This is a true rarity and a cornerstone piece of any Beatles collection. The album cover ended up being so extravagant that it cost £3,000, equivalent to £50,000 in today's money . Peter Blake (pictured) and Jann Haworth designed the iconic cover using an ink drawing by Paul McCartney as inspiration . Paul McCartney had the initial idea for the iconic cover and outlined the cover in an ink drawing. The actual designing of the cover was done by artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth. The cover’s collage of famous faces includes 57 cardboard cut-out photographs (including two gnomes) and nine waxworks. They show a range of personalities from different walks of life including actors, sportsmen and scientists. The album also reflects the personal and artistic changes within the band at the time Sgt Pepper's was made. The influence of George Harrison’s exploration of Indian music and philosophy through the inclusion of self-realisation gurus. The fab four themselves appear in day-glow, mock military uniforms. Paul McCartney envisioned the Sgt Peppers band as alter egos the Beatles could use to distance themselves from their previous incarnations. John Lennon requested the inclusion of Hitler and Jesus in the artwork but he was turned down. Elvis did not appear on the album cover because it was felt he was too big an icon to be included. 'Designer Peter Blake worked with the Beatles to stage the cover of Sgt. Pepper's, which was filled with life-size cardboard likenesses of famous figures - Mae West, Bob Dylan, Marlon Brando - behind the Beatles. 'Among the smaller items in the foreground was this garden gnome, which appears just to the right of George's leg. 'At the end of the cover session on March 30, 1967, the gnome was chosen as a memento by an assistant to cover photographer Michael Cooper, and it was signed by the Beatles immediately following the shoot.

417,c7caf9181c2e94a79d9102da6e11cde48c880aa5,"(CNN)The United States and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Thursday that limits Iran's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon. Expect pushback anyway, if the recent past is any harbinger. Just last month, in an attempt to head off such an agreement, House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress, and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal. The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light. It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions. Let us address some of these: . The most misleading assertion, despite universal rejection by experts, is that the negotiations' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in Iran. That is the position of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U.S. Congress. But that is not and never was the objective. If it had been, there would have been no Iranian team at the negotiating table. Rather, the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that Iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the United States and its allies could respond. The new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal. It would reduce Iran's low-enriched uranium stockpile, cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime. Another dubious assumption of opponents is that the Iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program. Despite sharp accusations by some in the United States and its allies, Iran denies having such a program, and U.S. intelligence contends that Iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon. Iran's continued cooperation with International Atomic Energy Agency inspections is further evidence on this point, and we'll know even more about Iran's program in the coming months and years because of the deal. In fact, the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the Iranians. What's more, the rhetoric of some members of Congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the United States and Iran (i.e., the 47 senators' letter warning that a deal might be killed by Congress or a future president). This of course is not the case. The talks were between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (United States, United Kingdom, France, China and Russia) plus Germany, dubbed the P5+1. While the United States has played a leading role in the effort, it negotiated the terms alongside its partners. If the agreement reached by the P5+1 is rejected by Congress, it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on Iran and threaten NATO cohesion in other areas. Another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause, after which Iran will be free to do as it pleases. Again, this is not the case. Some of the restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities, such as uranium enrichment, will be eased or eliminated over time, as long as 15 years. But most importantly, the framework agreement includes Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol, which allows IAEA inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared. This provision will be permanent. It does not sunset. Thus, going forward, if Iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels, monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the U.N. Security Council. Many in Congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the Senate to ""advise and consent."" But the issue is not suited for a treaty. Treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories. For example, the New START treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads. But any agreement with Iran will not be so balanced.  The restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on Iran. The P5+1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions, which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal. Finally some insist that any agreement must address Iranian missile programs, human rights violations or support for Hamas or Hezbollah.  As important as these issues are, and they must indeed be addressed, they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal: preventing a nuclear Iran.  To include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill. This agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies, including Israel. Those judgments should be fact-based, not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions.","Richard Klass: Iran framework agreement on nukes is strong, but opponents will cast doubts on this and try to obscure its facts .
He says the deal would cut uranium stockpile, centrifuges, implement rigorous inspections; it should be judged on merits, not disinformation ."

The former Portugal international, in Egypt at the CAF Congress to canvass for votes, told Sportsmail he did not believe all Africa was solidly behind Blatter, who seeks re-election on May 29 against Figo, Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan and the Dutch football association president Michael van Praag. 'I feel there's a lot of respect for CAF among all the African federations but I'm positive that (CAF president) Mr (Issa) Hayatou did not speak in the name of the 54 members of the confederation,' said the former Barcelona and Real Madrid midfielder.

Blatter (left) has received the backing of African football's president Issa Hayatou (right) 'Even when he (Hayatou) announced he would support Blatter, we could notice a difference from past congresses when a statement like that normally is followed by a standing ovation. 'This time we heard just a normal applause, which confirms my idea that a lot of African countries understand and agree with the need to change for the better of everyone, especially the national associations. 'In fact there were federation presidents who ensured me they would vote for me but they were reluctant to saying this out loud because they feared reactions against them, their federations and even their countries,' said Figo. 'It also to end this kind of atmosphere that I decided to be a candidate. Football should be about a beautiful game and people should be able to express themselves freely and openly.' Figo (left) and Michael van Pragg (right) are opposing Blatter and have chosen to run for presidency . Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is the third challenger and the FIFA vice-president was in attendance in Zimbabwe . The CAF congress in Cairo ended on Tuesday with Hayatou declaring Africa's complete support for Blatter's re-election but on all previous occasions when the CAF chief has promised a block of African votes, many have broken ranks. When Blatter came to power in 1998, Hayatou pledged Africa's votes to rival Lennart Johansson of Sweden but most defied him to vote Blatter into power.

420,919e6284ad7e39b29f4e3aa3bf4cbb7277fcd5d3,"Lord Janner sent a ‘thank you’ Christmas card to a detective after learning he would escape child sex abuse charges, it emerged yesterday . Lord Janner sent a ‘thank you’ Christmas card to a detective after learning he would escape child sex abuse charges, it emerged yesterday. The officer said he was appalled by the Labour peer’s note after his superiors forced him to drop his inquiries into Janner’s alleged sex abuse. The note thanked him for how he had dealt with the issue, and even invited him and his wife to dinner at Parliament. The revelation of Janner’s apparent attempt to influence the police came amid fresh concerns about the Establishment cover-up of the Labour grandee’s alleged paedophilia. Detectives have carried out four child sex inquiries into Janner since 1991, but attempts to bring him to justice were repeatedly blocked. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders announced earlier this month that he should been have charged on each occasion. But she went on to rule that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia. The decision has caused outrage – with critics pointing out that he signed letters in the House of Lords as recently as this month, and had held numerous dinners and events in Parliament since being diagnosed in 2009. It has also been revealed that Mrs Saunders was a pupil at the same legal chambers as Janner – although she claims she never met him. The furore over her decision grew yesterday as it emerged that: . The policeman who led the original investigation into Janner in the early 1990s spoke yesterday of how he was ‘gutted’ after orders to drop the case came ‘from the very top’. Retired Detective Inspector Kelvyn Ashby, of Leicestershire Police, said his team uncovered evidence supporting allegations that the then-Leicester MP used his home and a hotel to abuse a teenage boy. He said he and fellow investigator Mick Creedon, now Chief Constable of Derbyshire Police, were prevented from arresting Janner. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders ruled that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia . ‘Someone higher up told us that we couldn’t just arrest an MP and it went no further. We were told that by someone senior, who I can’t name, but the order had to have come from the very top. I’m sure my bosses’ hands were tied,’ he told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I was extremely frustrated. Janner should have been arrested. He was treated differently because he was an MP.’ Mr Ashby, 65, added: ‘The bit that really got me was that I later got a Christmas card in the post from Greville Janner. ‘The card was an official House of Commons Christmas card and was handwritten. Retired Detective Inspector Kelvyn Ashby, of Leicestershire Police, received a thank you note from Janner . ‘It said something like “I was very pleased with the way you treated me” and invited me and my wife for a dinner at the House of Commons. I couldn’t believe it. My wife was disgusted, as was I. Needless to say we never replied and never went.’ The decision not to charge Janner in 1991 was taken just weeks after Sir Allan Green quit as Director of Public Prosecutions when he was caught kerb crawling in King’s Cross in London. His deputy David Gandy took over temporarily until a full-time replacement was appointed the next year. But Mr Gandy, 83, yesterday said he could not remember seeing Janner’s case file. He told The Daily Mail: ‘I have no knowledge of it whatsoever. It may well be the decision was taken by someone else in the department or it could have been sent out for senior counsel to make a decision on. Whatever happened I simply don’t have any knowledge of it.’ Even Janner’s barrister, the late George Carman QC, who was instructed to defend him after the abuse allegations became public in 1991, was astonished that he escaped prosecution. His son Dominic Carman said: ‘My father was surprised that Janner was not charged. ‘He suspected there may have been some attempt to influence the decision by the DPP, although there was no proof.’ Investigative website Exaro said the four experts who examined the peer had not all agreed on the six key points about the nature and extent of his illness outlined in Mrs Saunders’s statement on why she was not going to charge him. Janner’s family have issued a statement insisting he is ‘entirely innocent of any wrongdoing’. Lawyers for Janner’s alleged victims could demand medical tests to check the extent of his dementia. Child abuse campaigners have questioned how the former Labour MP was able to sign a letter to the House of Lords on April 9, just a week before prosecutors said he would not face charges because of his deteriorating dementia. Now it has emerged that Janner could be examined by experts as part of compensation claims brought by his alleged victims. Richard Scorer, of law firm Slater and Gordon, told the Observer: ‘I have certainly dealt with civil claims before where the alleged abuser has claimed to have dementia, and we have been able to have them medically examined in relation to that.’","Janner sent the card to detective after learning he would not be charged .

421,44d681105bcab063dfa0c80ce9cf96393677f9cc,"(CNN)A Connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being, according to her attorney, Josh Michtom. A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen, identified in court documents as ""Cassandra C.,"" go home. The judge also denied a motion for visitation. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. On March 16, Michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness. Michtom and attorney Michael Taylor, who represents Cassandra's mother, Jackie Fortin, released a written statement after receiving the judge's decision Wednesday: ""We are disappointed in this ruling, not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence. We're conferring with our clients now about next steps, including whether to take another appeal."" Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days, according to court documents, when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body. In December, a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. At that time, she was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then.  Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them. Cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned, according to Michtom. ""She's seen in her case the side effects weren't bad, and she's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment,"" he said. Her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month. Michtom and Taylor failed in their effort before the Connecticut Supreme Court to make the case that Cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions. Joette Katz, the commissioner of the Department of Children and Families, told CNN in March the agency is ""very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery. We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life."" The agency has denied CNN's request to speak with Cassandra or her physicians. According to Michtom, the Department of Children and Families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but hasn't. He said the department sees Cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before. Representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with Michtom and Taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once Cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of April -- and that she'll be allowed to return home. So for now, Cassandra is said to spend her days reading, watching TV and drawing. ""The hospital is effectively jail,"" Michtom said.","Judge won't allow teen leave hospital before her last chemotherapy treatment .
Attorneys for the teen are deciding whether to appeal .
Cassandra C. is now in remission and is no longer opposed to the chemotherapy treatments ."

Lance Corporal Leonard Keysor, 30, received a Victoria Cross for his 48-hour effort that saw him lob live, palm-sized iron grenades from the trenches of Lone Pine to save the lives of his comrades. The Victoria Cross is the highest military honour an Australian can receive. LCpl Keysor even caught some of the bombs in mid-air, Channel 7's Sunday Night reported. Scroll down for video . Lance Corporal Leonard Keysor served during World War I in Gallipoli and was awarded a Victoria Cross medal . The 30-year-old fought in the trenches at Lone Pine in Anzac Cove on the shores of Turkey . LCpl Keysor signed up just before the start of the war in 1914 as a pilot but instead was sent to the shores of Turkey. He had moved to Sydney after living in Canada for 10 years and had been a clerk for most of his life. In Australia, he discovered cricket and it soon became a passion for the young man. Anzac War Memorial's Brad Manera said LCpl Keysor was an unlikely candidate to become a bomb thrower, but his strong arm soon solidified him as an asset to the Australian army. 'He's one of those blokes that's obviously got great hand-eye coordination. He should have been a test cricketer,' Mr Manera told Victoria Cross winner Ben Roberts-Smith who was hosting the Sunday Night special to mark the Anzac centenary. Every time LCpl Keysor picked up a grenade, he was risking his life to save others as Turkish bombs only had an eight-second fuse while soldiers were being killed around him. LCpl was awarded the VC for his 48-hour effort where he threw live grenades back at the enemy . His grand niece, Keira Quinn Lockyer, said her great uncle was a humble man who did not think he did anything special . 'He doesn't know how many seconds, how many fractions of a second he's got before he flings it back,' Mr Manera told the news program. 'It's a remarkable feat of endurance and every time he grabs one of those grenades he's putting his life on the line and he's doing it hundreds of times over a period of 48 hours.' Not only was he throwing bombs back at the Turkish army, LCpl Keysor was also shielding the blasts by throwing sandbags on top of them and covering them with his coat. His grand niece, Keira Quinn Lockyer, who penned a book about LCpl Keysor's life was told it was 'one of the most sustained acts of bravery' during World War I. Anzac War Memorial's Brad Manera said each time LCpl Keysor picked up a Turkish bomb he was risking his life . The Sunday Night special was hosted by Victoria Cross recipient Ben Roberts-Smith who served in Afghanistan . A Sunday Night re-enactment shows Turkish bombs as palm-sized, iron grenades (left), which were then lobbed over trench walls back at the enemy by LCpl Keysor (right) 'It wasn't something that was done in the heat of the moment. It was something that was sustained for days,' she told Sunday Night. Ms Lockyer revealed her great uncle was a humble man and referred to his time at Gallipoli as the 'only adventure he ever had'. 'I'm proud of Leonard obviously and Leonard made the comment many times that ""I didn't do anything more special than others. I was noticed and that was the difference"",' she said. 'He thought he was no more deserving than any other of the soldiers at Lone Pine that day.'","Leonard Keysor, 30, was a bomb thrower during World War I at Gallipoli .

Oleg Maidanovich said someone was hiding satellites as space junk (artist's illustration of a satellite shown). But in a film he refused to name the country behind the ruse . The claims were made by the commander of Russian Space Command, Oleg Maidanovich. He was speaking on a film called ‘Space Special Forces’ during a tour of Russia’s main centre for aerospace intelligence in Krasnoznamensk, near Moscow. ‘Very recently, specialists of the department of space intelligence centre uncovered a newly created group of space satellites... made for radio-technical reconnaissance of equipment on Russian territory,’ he said. A reconnaissance satellite is unofficially referred to as a spy satellite. They are Earth observation satellites or communications satellites traditionally used for military or intelligence purposes. Some are used to simply take images from the ground, while others relay information from one place to another. Many such satellites are used today for high-resolution photography of certain areas, for scientific or defense purposes. The film goes on to state that there ‘are cases when a space satellite pretends to be space junk for years and then wakes up and starts working at the right moment.’ The comments were made yesterday on ‘Space Day’, when Russia commemorated the first human spaceflight - Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. Since then hundreds of rockets have been launched into space – and Russia itself now has about 140 satellites operating in orbit. Their Space Command is a division of the military responsible for warning of missile and air strikes and controlling Russia's defence satellites. It monitors about 20,000 objects orbiting the planet, out of a total of 100,000 significant objects. Some objects are believed to have a military purpose - but it’s not quite clear what the purpose of the satellites disguised as space junk are. MailOnline has asked the Russian space agency (Roscosmos) and Space Command for further information on the claim.

424,2c331e5becaa7fbc27441de8ee18f48a88b2efc4,"(CNN)Aaron Hernandez is known for his swagger. Should he act any differently when he's on trial for murder? When the once rising star for the New England Patriots walks into court each day with what appears to be an air of confidence -- or is it bravado? -- he enters from a connecting holding room. Some court security officers who escort him are as tall and muscular as he is. Besides that certain bounce to his step, there's usually a smile. Jury deliberations resume Wednesday . Watch ""Downward Spiral: Inside the Case against Aaron Hernandez"" tonight at 9 p.m. ET. It hasn't been there as often in the last couple of weeks when state witnesses have included his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins and his former boss, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who testified Hernandez would usually greet him with a kiss and a hug. Always impeccably dressed in suit and tie brought in by his defense team, Hernandez quickly scans the courtroom, usually starting with the rows of seats directly behind him. The front row is reserved for his family. Some days, none of his relatives is there. But when his mother, fiancée, brother and other friends attend, he winks, nods, smiles, jokes, laughs, flirts with his fiancée and mouths greetings to them including ""'thanks for coming' and 'I love you.'"" Twice, he nodded his head and smiled at me. It's not unusual for his lawyers to slap him on his back and huddle before court begins, appearing at ease. They've been representing him since June 2013. There was an unfortunate moment. His mother once asked permission from a court officer to touch her son once the jury left the room. Given an OK, she reached over the bar to him, took one of his hands in hers and kissed it. Rules forbid contact. It did not go unnoticed by the family of victim Odin Lloyd. Hernandez does not avoid looking in their direction. He glances at Lloyd's relatives. Lloyd's mother Ursula Ward, who is in court daily, appears to look right back at Hernandez without expression from her usual seat on the end of a row. When one witness, a high school friend, testifies that Hernandez once allegedly talked about carrying a gun, Hernandez appears to glare at him. When his fiancée takes the stand and testifies Hernandez told her to ditch a box from their basement the day after Lloyd's slaying, his eyes are glued on her. She barely glances his way but does appear to say something as she passes the defense table on the way out. When Kraft is asked to officially point out Hernandez in court and describe what he was wearing, I watch Hernandez look down at his shirt and tie as Kraft detailed his outfit. When the team owner leaves the stand -- the same man who signed him to a $40 million bonus in 2012 -- Hernandez turns and watches him walk out of the courtroom. Would it be the last time he'd see him in person? On the last day of testimony when his defense rests its case, he smiles at relatives. But as he walks out the door this time, he doesn't look back.","Aaron Hernandez, even when on trial for murder, keeps that certain bounce in his step .

425,7adaffbe0066e60ebfa947d01b698aecccb00116,"Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini insists that reports Xherdan Shaqiri is set to leave the club this summer are 'completely made up'. The Switzerland international joined the Italians from Bayern Munich in January for a fee in the region of £12million, signing a four-and-a-half year contract. The 23-year-old made a fine start to his Inter career but has tailed off in recent weeks and has found himself dropped to the bench for the previous two Serie A matches. Xherdan Shaqiri joined Inter Milan from Bayern Munich in the January transfer window . And it has been suggested that Inter are looking to offload the attacking midfielder at the end of the season, but Mancini has rubbished the speculation insisting Shaqiri can have a big future in Italy. 'This Shaqiri thing is completely made up,' he told reporters. 'We bought Shaqiri last January because we think that he can have a big future at Inter. Then during the season, there might be a moment when a player's form drops, and there are other players that in that moment are able to step in. So that's the only situation going on right now. 'Shaqiri has our full confidence. He is our player. Then he has also changed his team, so it's normal that he might struggle at a certain stage. Shaqiri has been dropped to the bench by Roberto Mancini in recent matches . 'It's not that he can join a new club and altogether be the one that single-handedly wins games by himself. 'He will always have a drop in form at a certain stage so in that moment there are other players ready to step in - they are normally there for that reason. So one only plays when he deserves to play. 'We bought Shaqiri because we believe in his qualities,' Mancini added. The Inter boss insists Shaqiri will not be leaving the club despite reports to the contrary . 'Then if Bayern [Munich] decided to sell him, it's because they have so many players that eventually they have reached the conclusion that Shaqiri is a young player and that he needs to play. 'Inter could be the right solution for him and we are happy about this. I am sure that Shaqiri next season will achieve great things.'","Xherdan Shaqiri joined Inter Milan from Bayern Munich in January this year .

In an interview with Town & Country Magazine, the 68-year-old revealed that he believes he has lost his natural flair for political campaigning, adding that becoming a grandparent to his daughter Chelsea's six-month-old daughter Charlotte has tamed the angry side of his personality which once helped to propel him to victory. 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody. I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad.' he said. Scroll down for video . Back seat? President Clinton plans to stay out of the limelight if and when Hillary Clinton launches her expected run for president, he tells Town and Country Magazine in a new interview . Doting grandparents: The Clintons had long spoken of their desire to have a grandchild - a dream which came true last year when their daughter Chelsea gave birth to baby Charlotte (pictured) Undecided role: 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody. I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad,' he said . 'I think it's important, and Hillary does too, that she go out there as if she's never run for anything before and establish her connection with the voters and that my role should primarily be as a backstage adviser to her until we get much, much closer to the election.' The interview provides a rare inside look at the couple's mindset ahead of a widely expected impending presidential announcement. According to reports, Mrs Clinton is currently in the process of preparing to launch her bid within the next two weeks, and she's rumored to have already signed a lease for her campaign office in Brooklyn. However, she has to officially declare as a candidate within the next two weeks if she is going to run. If Mrs Clinton is elected, the former President added that his wife 'would have to assess what she wants me to do'. In addition to his new, calmer outlook on life, former President Clinton may have other reasons for wanting to avoid playing an active part in his wife's campaign. Ready for more? Mrs Clinton is widely expected to launch a bid within the next two weeks . Looking back: The former President's role in Hillary's 2008 campaign was reportedly a source of great tension in the Clinton camp . According to reports at the time, his role in his wife's 2008 campaign was a source of great tension in the Clinton camp. Many of his political advisers joined her campaign, and some of them didn't get on with Mrs Clinton's staff. And this time around, Mrs Clinton is thought to be off on a good foot, holding a substantial lead over her fellow Democrats, as well as a top spot in general election polling. Mr Clinton added that the couple has not discussed what her campaign – or her potential election – would mean for their philanthropic foundation. 'We might have to change the [foundation] rules again. But we haven't talked about that yet, and I don't think we should,' he said. 'You can't. It's hard for any party to hang onto the White House for 12 years, and it's a long road. A thousand things could happen.' Whatever occurs, Mr Clinton's priority is to keep the foundation alive whether he's running it or not. Outspoken: The former President previously sparked controversy on his wife's campaign trail, including with remarks about President Obama's 2008 campaign being a 'fairytale' ahead of the South Carolina primary . Groundbreaking: Mrs Clinton has the chance to become the first female president in American history, which would make former President Clinton as the 'First Man' The Bill effect: Mrs Clinton is ahead in the polls and it is thought that the Democrats would like to see her run for the White House. The family is pictured at former President Clinton's second inauguration . The Clinton Foundation is running 3,100 projects around the world, affecting the lives of 430 million people. The former President has spoken about life as a grandfather and how watching baby Charlotte grow has been 'a hoot'. 'It's amazing,' Mr Clinton said on the Ellen Show towards the end of last year. 'Hillary and I only have one child and she's quite wonderful, but it's been a long time since she's been that age.' Meanwhile, daughter Chelsea has said her parents are totally involved in their granddaughter's life, all the way down to changing diapers. She told Jimmy Kimmel that they are  embracing their new roles as grandma and grandpa Clinton. 'They're changing diapers, reading to her, helping her go to sleep at night,' she said. 'It's just been such a joy for me to watch them sort of rediscover that part of their lives and to watch them as grandparents.'","Former First Lady Hillary Clinton has not announced whether or not she will run for President .

428,8275364d165bdfdec989a558185d1dbb09a43f67,"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers vowed not to give up on Champions League qualification after a convincing 2-0 win over Newcastle. The Reds moved within four points of the Barclays Premier League top four after goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen saw off the struggling Magpies at Anfield. With fading champions Manchester City now looking vulnerable in fourth, Liverpool's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back-to-back losses to Manchester United and Arsenal - could have been reignited. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener . Rodgers said: 'The players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can. We have shown we can put results together consistently. We have important players coming back which is good news. 'But we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning. 'There are teams above us but, as we have seen last year, there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes.' Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead . Liverpool, inspired by Philippe Coutinho, started superbly with Sterling scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created. Newcastle rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but Allen made the game safe in the second half. Rodgers said: 'It was a good performance. I thought that our attacking play was very bright, we looked exciting going forward, we worked hard in the midfield. Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as Krul picks himself up from Anfield turf . 'At times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals.' The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Their misery was compounded when Moussa Sissoko was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence, when he caught Lucas Leiva on the ankle. Manager John Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, however. Allen secured three points for Liverpool that narrowed the gap on Manchester City . He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball . Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough. 'There are lot of positives to take from the game. A lot of people expected us to get a hiding and I think we held our own for the majority of the game.'","Liverpool beat Newcastle 2-0 in the Premier League on Monday night .

It was not clear what caused the explosion at the Fresno County Sheriff's gun range that brought traffic in the area to a halt. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road alongside Highway 99, according to Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims. Scroll down for video . A fireball erupts after a large gas pipeline exploded in Fresno, California, on Friday. The explosion and fire closed both directions of Highway 99, authorities said . A firefighter watches the blaze shot well over 100 feet into the air. Eleven people were injured, three critically, in the explosion . The flames shot well over 100 feet into the air, witnesses said. Traffic heading north and south on Highway 99 in Fresno was halted by the explosion about 2.30pm as flames towered over the roadway, the California Highway Patrol reported. The highway was reopened three hours later, the CHP said. The driver of the front-loader was a county public works employee who had been working at the shooting range all day working on a tall berm that confines gunfire to the range, Mims said. Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said. Three inmates were evaluated and sent back to jail, and two deputies were being evaluated for ringing ears and exposure to the hot blast. Four patients were being treated at Community Regional Medical Center's burn and trauma unit, spokeswoman Mary Lisa Russell said. Three of them are in critical condition and one is in serious condition. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened at the gun range while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road, according to authorities . Pacific Gas & Electric crews are seen in the distance along the Fresno road after the massive explosion . Four other patients were taken to St. Agnes Hospital and three more to Madera Community Hospital. Asked whether the driver was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded, Mims said her office is investigating. 'Hopefully we'll be able to speak to the worker to see what action he was taking at the time,' she said. Mims noted PG&E had, some time ago, marked the location of gas lines in the construction zones. The flames prompted a two-alarm call of firefighters, said Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department. A nearby rail line was also halted out of concern that a passing train could spark leaking gas. Kevin Ling was driving by shortly after the blast, and he saw fire flying into the sky. 'As I got closer, the flames were just bigger and bigger,' he said. 'It was shooting up to 200 feet or more, and a fireball maybe ten-to-15 feet in diameter. It was like out of a movie.' 'My window was up and my AC was on and it still felt like a furnace inside my car,' he added. Emergency respondents gather near the scene of a gas line rupture. Those who were injured were taken to several different hospitals in the area . Highway 99, a major highway in central California, was closed in both directions after the gas-line explosion . The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Martinez said. A front-loader was in the area, but it's unclear if the vehicle was digging at the time of the explosion, he said, adding that 'it was a large explosion that shook the surrounding area'. PG&E spokesman Denny Boyles said the pipeline was damaged by a vehicle and that the line was buried but he didn't know how deeply. The flame from the pipe was extinguished at about an hour and a half after the blast, he said. Another PG&E spokesman, Keith Stephens, referred questions to local authorities. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are reported to be injured,' he said. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office is investigation as to whether the driver of a front-loader doing work in the area was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded . The California Public Utilities Commission said in a statement that it is investigating the explosion in cooperation with the Federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. PG&E's natural-gas operations have been under scrutiny following a fiery 2010 PG&E pipeline blast that killed eight people in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno. National Transportation Safety Board investigators blamed faulty safety practices by PG&E, and lax oversight by state regulators, for the 2010 blast. Earlier this month, state regulators leveled the state's biggest-ever penalty against a utility - $1.6billion - against PG&E for the San Bruno blast. California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker said at the time that continuing safety citations against the utility made him doubt that the utility had embraced a culture of safety, and he raised the possibility of breaking apart the utility's gas and electric operations. The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department, said . Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said.

431,844d8e14440f1f22cf348279b7c8805745704651,"Google launched a new U.S. wireless service today that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks . Google is already the world’s most popular phone software provider, and a pay-TV operator - and now it wants to be your mobile network carrier. The company has unveiled a U.S. wireless service that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks to curb data use and keep phone bills low. The service, called 'Project Fi,' debuted today, about two months after Google revealed its plans to expand its ever-growing empire into providing wireless connections for smartphones. Google is selling the basic phone service for $20 a month and will only charge customers for the amount of cellular data that they use each month, instead of a flat rate. Each gigabyte of data will cost $10 a month. That means a customer could sign up for a plan offering three gigabytes of data and get $20 back if only one gigabyte was used in a month. Most wireless phone carriers allow their customers to roll over unused data into another month of service without refunding any money. Project Wi-Fi initially will only be sold to a narrow US audience that owns the Nexus 6, a smartphone that Motorola Mobility made with Google's help. Google's pricing setup makes Project Fi less expensive than most of the comparable plans offering by the four biggest wireless phone carriers - Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. The monthly prices for a single line of smartphone service with up to one gigabyte of cellular data at those carriers range from $45 to $50 compared to $30 from Google. The major carriers, though, offer a variety of family plans that could still be better deals than Project Fi. Those bundled plans allow several phone lines to share a pool of cellular data. Scroll down for video . Besides trying to bring down the prices of wireless phone plans, Google is promising subscribers that their Nexus 6 model will automatically connect with the fastest network available. Rather than building its own network, Google is leasing space on cellular towers built by Sprint and T-Mobile, which are hoping the deals will boost their profits without costing them too many customers tempted to defect to Project Fi. To use the service, Nexus 6 owners must sign-up to request an invitation, must have a Gmail address, and must live in a US zip code within the coverage area. In this map, the dark green areas are covered by the service's 4G LT, the lime green is covered by 3G and the pale green by 2G . Verizon 4G LTE coverage is pictured for comparison. Project Fi will be hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile's networks . The service will work only on the company's Nexus 6 phones and only in the US . Project Fi will be hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile's networks. Overall, it costs $20 for basic service, which includes unlimited domestic talk, unlimited texting, tethering, and access in 120 countries. Customers pay $10 per GB of data. Data is paid for in advance, and the cost of unused data gets refunded rather than rolled over or lost. Phone numbers will live in the cloud so that consumers can talk and text on any connected tablet. Calls can be made via Hangouts on Android, iOS, and through Gmail on desktops, via the Hangouts widget. Texts can be made and received in the same way. There is no annual service contract required when you sign up . To use the service, Nexus 6 owners must sign-up to request an invitation, must have a Gmail address, and must live in a US zip code within the coverage area. Google is promising Project Fi will automatically switch over to an available Wi-Fi network if that is running at a higher speed than the cellular alternatives. T-Mobile CEO John Legere, whose company already has been cutting its prices and rolling out new options, said it was a 'no-brainer' to work with Google on Project Fi. 'Anything that shakes up the industry status quo is a good thing — for both US wireless customers and T-Mobile,' Legere wrote in a blog post. Google has an incentive to promote cheaper and faster wireless service as a mobile virutal network operator. This is because it operates some of the world's most popular online services, including its search engine, maps, Gmail and YouTube video site. The Mountain View, California, company believes most people will visit those services more frequently if they are enticed to stay online for longer periods, giving Google more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. Similar motives prompted Google to begin building high-speed, hard-wired networks capable of navigating the Internet at speeds up to 100 times faster than existing broadband services. Although Google is only selling its broadband service in a handful of U.S. cities so far, AT&T and Comcast are now offering options with comparable speeds in a few communities. Price in Dollars: This graphic shows how much Google's new Project Fi will cost for various plans. For Talk and Text only, the Google carrier will cost $20 a month as compared to $35 for new partner TMobile. However the savings really start when 5GB of LTE is consider - with the Internet search giant's plan coming in at $70 and telecom giant Verizon's costing $110 a month .

Woods has started just two events in 2015, shooting a career-worst score of 82 to miss the cut in the first of them and withdrawing through injury after just 11 holes of the second on February 5. That led to the 14-time major winner taking a break from competition to work on his game, during which time he dropped outside the world's top 100 for the first time since September 1996, a slide which continued on Monday as he fell from 104th to 111th.

The 39-year-old is returning from a self-imposed break from golf to recover from injuries and a dip in form . Woods was given a warm welcome by the crowd and stopped to sign several autographs at Augusta . Woods has not won a major since the 2008 US Open and the last of his four Masters wins was a decade ago, with the 39-year-old only confirming on Friday that he would compete at Augusta. However, after showing no sign of the chipping 'yips' which blighted his performance in Phoenix on the range, Woods produced some vintage shots as he completed the front nine alongside long-time friend Mark O'Meara before playing the 10th and 18th alone. 'I felt good. It was nice to get out here,' said Woods, who was two under after four holes despite a wayward drive on the first and three-putting the par-five second for a par. 'Chipping is fine. I wanted to test out some wedges out here. That was why I was chipping a little bit more. It came down to a couple of different bounce settings because it's different from Florida. We figured the right one out. 'It's been a process. But I'm on the good side now. It's progression. I felt like I had to get my game into a spot where I could compete to win a golf tournament and it's finally there.' Woods has not won a major since the US Open in 2008 and will be looking to get back to his best . Woods stopped to chat to Europe's Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke (right) at Augusta on Monday . O'Meara, who won the Masters and Open in 1998, said: 'The thing about the kid is that you can never underestimate Tiger Woods. I'm a huge fan, a friend and I care about him. 'It was good to be out there with him. I saw some good signs. His pitching looks a lot better. 'There's a lot of pressure on him but there is no reason why he should not have a good week this week. 'There are not many people that have played the game of golf like he has. The game of golf is better because of Tiger Woods. 'He is in a good place and I think he is fired up about it. He will be nervous on Thursday but I think he will be fine. He hit a couple of shots that were a little off but a lot of quality shots.' Earlier in the day, US Open champion Martin Kaymer said he still felt Woods was 'the man,' but added: 'Who really knows what is going on in his head?

But what would bother me a lot is all the speculation. You don't have a choice; you will read about it somewhere. You will hear about it because you socialise with people. 'So mentally it must be quite exhausting and we know how important the mental part is in golf. It's difficult and some things I don't find very fair. You know, you should just let him be. Let him play golf, what he likes to do. 'Sometimes I look at it and find it quite sad how people treat the whole subject. It shouldn't be like this in my opinion. But that's how it is unfortunately. That is how a lot of people make their money and some athletes, they suffer because of that. 'Hopefully he's strong enough, he has people to talk to, and he finds a way to compete as good as he can. Because we all know when he's around, somehow it does make us play better, as well. 'I never experienced someone who played better than him. In my era, I never played with Seve (Ballesteros) and I never played with Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, those guys.

European Commission antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said . Gazprom was barring EU clients from selling on its gas to other . states - a particular concern in recent efforts to aid Ukraine - and pressuring governments to back its pipeline interests. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the charges were 'absolutely unacceptable'. The European Union launched a legal attack on Gazprom on Wednesday, stoking tensions with Moscow as it accused the Russian gas giant of overcharging buyers in Eastern Europe and hindering competition . European Commission antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager (pictured) said Gazprom was barring EU clients from selling on its gas to otherstates . State-controlled Gazprom is a vital supplier of energy to . Europe despite the EU's frequent political disputes with Moscow. The Commission's investigation, opened in September 2012, . had initially covered Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, . Hungary, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Relations with Russia, and Gazprom in particular, have since . been poisoned more by the East-West confrontation over Ukraine. 'Gazprom is dominant in all these markets,' EU Competition . Commissioner Vestager told a news conference. 'Our preliminary . view alleges that Gazprom is abusing this position.' 'Gazprom has been able to charge higher prices in some . countries without fearing that ... gas would flow in from where . prices were lower,' she said of contracts with the three . ex-Soviet Baltic states and formerly communist Poland and . Bulgaria. Vestager said prices in some countries were as much as 40 . per cent higher than in others. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite welcomed the . charges, saying: 'The era of Kremlin-backed political and . economic blackmail draws to a close.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the charges were 'absolutely unacceptable' Noting the investigation had begun before Russia annexed . Crimea from Ukraine, Vestager said 'this case is not political' but acknowledged some would see political elements in it. Gazprom responded by calling the charges, to which it has 12 . weeks to respond, 'unfounded' and saying it expected a . resolution within the framework of previous undertakings between . the Kremlin and Brussels 'on the intergovernmental level'. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that the EU charges against Gazprom were an unacceptable attempt to retroactively apply the bloc's latest energy rules to earlier contracts. Asked to comment on the case, Lavrov said in an interview with three radio stations: 'All contracts in effect now that Gazprom signed with its partners, were signed with full respect of the legal regime that existed in the EU at the time. 'After the EU adopted the so-called third energy package... there have been attempts, and they continue now, to retrospectively, retroactively apply those requirements to old contracts as well. That is absolutely unacceptable.' The EU has brokered deals to keep gas flowing to Ukraine . despite the conflict between Kiev and Moscow, but efforts to . supply gas via eastern EU states have been hindered by contracts . with Gazprom that prohibit the re-export of Russian gas. Gazprom had also pressured Poland and Bulgaria into . accepting unfavourable terms over gas pipeline control and . construction, the commissioner said. The decision to move against Gazprom comes a week after . Vestager charged U.S. tech giant Google with abusing . its market power, following five years of hesitation by her . predecessor. She said, however, that in other cases she would be . willing to negotiate with firms without pressing charges. The Dane has appeared determined to challenge big corporate . powers since taking on the powerful post in November, regardless . of past offers of compromise from both Google and Gazprom. Despite insisting she would look only at the legal merits of . a case that focuses on Gazprom's pricing policies for different . customers, the accusations will not ease frictions with Moscow . over Ukraine in which gas supplies have played a major role. Gazprom offered concessions to Vestager's predecessor last . year in a bid to settle the case and avoid a possible fine but . talks failed over its refusal to cut prices in eastern Europe. The Russian behemoth, with annual sales of some $100 . billion, supplies about 30 per cent of the 28-nation EU's natural . gas. It has been under investigation since September 2012, . including for hampering the flow of gas across Europe. Vestager can order companies to change their business . practices and is theoretically able to levy fines of up to 10 . per cent of their annual global turnover.","Antitrust chief  said Gazprom is barring EU clients from selling on its gas .

435,93c1f2e19b66d2c7409aeb7aeb1b03e1f9f3c241,"A federal judge has ordered the Internal Revenue Service to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status. The decision from U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott means right-wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class-action lawsuit against the IRS. The agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010, when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red-flag words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names. While those organizations' applications were held up for years, liberal groups sailed through the process. Federal tax-exempt status is confered on groups that serve a public purpose, including issue advocacy, and allows them to promise tax deductions to their donors. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . F.U.I.R.S.: American conservatives were up in marks in 2013 after the IRS confirmed it had been slow-walking tax-exemption applications from tea party groups based on red-flag words in their names . Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the heart of the tea party targeting scandal, ran the 'Exempt Organizations' division until late 2013 when she retired with full benefits; the Justice Department said this week that it won't prosecute her for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions . Tax-exempt organizations are not permitted to work for or against candidates for public office, but they can use up to half of their funds to make public arguments about political matters like tax policy, the Obamacare insurance overhaul, the environment or foreign policy. Dlott agreed this week that the tea party groups suing the government can pursue their claims that the IRS violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights, along with a section of federal law – Section 6103 of Title 26 – that prohibits the government from releasing private information contained in tax returns. When the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General investigated the IRS's actions, it demanded – and received – a list of 298 groups whose tax-exemption applications had been held up. It's this list that the tea party groups want. Their lawsuit aims first to identify a list of 'all dissenting groups targeted for additional scrutiny by the IRS from January 20, 2009, through July 15, 2013.' Dlott could then choose to certify that list as a 'class' of plaintiffs. IRS commissioner John Koskinen has insisted that his agency is no longer targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny, and has offered to green-list any group that promises it will limit its political activity to 40 per cent of its budget – but some organizations are holdout out, claiming the law entitles them to a 50 per cent limit . The IRS's lawyers claimed that they couldn't provide the court with the names of all the groups, saying they would have to turn over the very documents that Section 6103 requires them to keep confidential. The conservative plaintiffs said they would be happy to have only the spreadsheet that the inspector general got from the IRS. Dlott agreed and ordered the agency to hand it over. 'The Court concludes that the return information sought is directly related to the issue of class certification in this federal court proceeding,' her ruling reads. 'The names of the putative class member organizations and their control dates – the date which the putative class member organizations submitted their applications for tax exempt status to the IRS – are directly related to the issue of class certification.' Dlott decided that without the list, the plaintiffs wouldn't be able to show all the disaffected conservative applicants it has already identified share common experiences at the hands of America's tax collectors. Courthouse News Service first reported her ruling. The IRS is the federal agency Americans most love to hate, polling worse in opinion surveys than Congress . A partial list was unearthed by USA Today in September 2013, showing that as of 2011 the IRS had questioned the political advocacy of 162 right-wing organizations and delayed approving their tax exemptions. In an IRS spreadsheet published online by the newspaper, partisan government officials characterized the activities of 21 of those groups as 'propaganda.' Dlott also ordered the IRS to tell the court whether or not that list was authentic, The Washington Times reported. Former IRS official Lois Lerner, who has been at the center of the targeting scandal since it emerged in 23 months ago, was facing the possibility of criminal Contempt of Congress charges until the Obama administration's Department of Justice declined on Monday to prosecute her. Lerner, under subpoena in May 2013, delivered an opening statement professing her innocence during a hearing but then refused to answer questions.","Right-wing groups want court to let them sue the IRS in a class-action lawsuit for violating their constitutional right to equal treatment .

436,34ad340fa41e205b95b37b00e8ccbc38afb3e68f,"(CNN)An American teenager who helped her boyfriend stuff her mother's lifeless body into a suitcase at an upmarket hotel in Bali has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Heather Mack, 19, who gave birth to her own daughter just weeks ago, was found guilty with her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack on the Indonesian island last August. Schaefer was sentenced to 18 years in prison for battering von Wiese-Mack to death in room 317 of the St. Regis Bali Resort. Schaefer had claimed he killed his girlfriend's mother in self-defense after a violent argument erupted over the young couple's relationship. The beaten body of von Wiese-Mack was found in a large silver suitcase that the couple had loaded in a waiting taxi outside the resort.  They told the driver they'd be back soon, but after a lengthy wait he alerted hotel staff who inspected the bag, noticed blood and called police. The lovers were arrested after being found the following morning at another hotel about 15 kilometers (nine miles) away. Inside the bag, von Wiese-Mack's body had been wrapped in hotel bedding. A forensic examination determined that she had died from a blunt force to the face that fractured her facial bones and caused her to suffocate. Described as a Chicago socialite, von Wiese-Mack was reported to have a troubled relationship with her teenage daughter. Schaefer denied that the murder was premeditated. He told the court that he acted in self-defense when his girlfriend's mother started strangling him during an argument in the Bali hotel room. ""She squeezed my neck for about 20 to 30 seconds. I couldn't breathe. I had blood going to my head and my eyes were so watery,"" Schaefer told the court. He said he reached for a nearby bowl ""before she could.""  ""I couldn't see for a moment because my eyes were so watery and I was distraught, I was in a state of mind, I had no idea what was happening. I was almost about to black out. And I grabbed it and I started swinging,"" he told the court. Mack told the court her mother had threatened to kill the couple's unborn baby, according to local media. The prosecutor alleged that the two planned the murder, because Mack's mother disapproved of their relationship. After being detained by police, the couple initially claimed they'd been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang, whose members killed Heather's mother, and from whom they managed to escape. The two were tried separately, though both trials were heard by the same court, with the same prosecutors. Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 18 years for Schaefer and 15 years for Mack. Under Indonesian law, Mack will be allowed to keep her baby with her in prison for two years, after which she can nominate who should take custody. Journalists Fairuz Husaini and Ragil Lestari and CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","Heather Mack jailed for 10 years over mother's murder in Bali .

438,904cb0fc85601ffc1f9c9652be14c6c3577f45eb,"Tehran, Iran (CNN)There is a Persian proverb that says: ""A good year is determined by its spring."" For many Iranians, the historic decision by Tehran and six world powers -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- to continue nuclear negotiations under a ""joint comprehensive plan of action"" is an indication that this year's Norouz, the Persian New Year that started on March 21, will be a superb one indeed. Although edgy hardliners may now try to play games and complain the preliminary agreement is not what they had hoped, for many people it shows excellent progress and that's what they want. It paves the way for a much broader deal by end of June that guarantees the peaceful nature of Tehran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions and a return to the international community. As is, the stakes are high and the choice is clear for President Hassan Rouhani and his ""moderate"" administration. They must now be over the moon: In early 2016, there will be Legislative and Assembly of Experts elections, the latter of which elects the country's leader. This historic agreement will make sure they win both the elections. So far, Rouhani's team has done nothing to improve the living conditions of ordinary Iranians who complain they have lost half of their purchasing power in recent years. READ MORE: Will Iran's Supreme Leader drink 'poison' of peace? During his presidential campaign, he promised to do so ""only"" if he could seal a nuclear deal with the world powers. And now he has. A full deal ultimately represents a referendum on the Rouhani administration's foreign policy. It will definitely strengthen his hand, which he needs to stay in the game, or better yet, win the next presidential race. The good news is that people are more than happy to welcome the preliminary agreement. They had always wanted a way out of the current impasse with the rest of the world and as a reward they could keep the moderates in power for the foreseeable future. Iranians blame sanctions and the previous hardline government for the sorry state of affairs in the economy -- especially the way they so poorly handled past nuclear talks of the past -- with devastating consequences. Many believe that now there is a joint comprehensive plan of action -- the culmination of a 12-year process -- there is something to hope for. In many respects, it's a new beginning and that allows Iranians a very small degree of hope inside themselves too. Looking back, the previous government traded those expectations for international isolation and economic hardship. Despite skepticism, even the country's leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, now feels that the light at the end of the tunnel might not be a train and that the talks could end well. READ MORE: What's in the Iran nuclear deal? 7 key points . Little wonder he had urged the nation -- including the well-funded hardliners -- to support the government's overture, saying the negotiating team was trustworthy and had been doing a fine job. It was a historic gesture that represents qualified support for continued diplomacy and that could lead to a historic step forward. It places confidence and hope in the negotiating team and the P5+1 group of world powers, guaranteeing no-one in Iran will stand in the way of principled diplomatic engagement and international rapprochement. Within this context, many Iranians are jubilant. They should be. More than ever, they are confident that not striking a comprehensive deal would be a historic mistake. They are confident it is within reach and this is as it should be: A win-win deal for all. They now strongly believe the lifting of international sanctions is no longer illusive. It would resuscitate the country's ailing economy and improve their lives. At least, that's what they hope. It's early spring and people on the streets are talking about nothing but the current choice. It represents the biggest chance of rapprochement between Tehran and Washington since the Iranian revolution in 1979. After all, for many Iranians this is more than just a nuclear agreement.","Deal between Iran and six world powers has given Iranians hope, writes Ghanbar Naderi .

It first became the capital of Myanmar a decade ago, after the government decided to move the capital from Yangon (also known as Rangoon) with minimal explanation. Since then, although developed to be the size of 120 Manhattans and to have space for up to one million residents, it remains a relative ghost town. Scroll down for video . Myanmar's newly-built capital city, Naypyidaw, is shrouded in secrecy, after the government decided to move the capital from Yangon . Built mainly for government staff, locals only come to live in the city, which looks more like no man's land than a booming metropolis, if they need to for work. The super-sized highways have up to 20 lanes and are built to be big enough for government SUVs, though some report that the massive roads were also constructed as runways to accommodate the landings of military. Official records state the population is just over 924,000, though any photographs taken would beg to differ. The streets are barren, with just a handful of individuals spotted walking or cycling through the secluded capital at any given point during the day. The city was developed mostly for government staff, including residential zones to house employees in four-storey apartment blocks . Despite a reported population of 924,000, the city's streets are barren and it's rare to see more than a couple of people at any given time . The building of Naypyidaw began in 2002, with it location chosen in the middle of a jungle that hadn't been lived in for more than 2,000 years. Although some government workers moved to the new capital at the beginning of 2005, many employees were separated from their families due to a lack of schools and other amenities. Split into various zones, the city keeps the government ministries far from the military area and there is also a designated commercial zone and hotel zone, despite a lack of tourism in the region. Burmese workers walk past the massive Parliament building surrounded by high gates and empty 10 lane roads . A street sweeper cleans this empty super-sized highway in the seemingly secluded capital city by hand with a broom . The residential areas are carefully organised into 1,200 four-storey apartment blocks. The roofs of the buildings are colour-coded by the jobs of their inhabitants. Despite the government-issued housing, many of the residents still live in slums. When it comes to recreational activities, there's the beautiful Uppatansanti Pagoda, which is similar in size and shape to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, as well as several parks and gardens, including a water fountain complex that hosts a musical light show each night. Foreigners and investors aren't keen to visit the secluded city and foreign aid workers prefer to commute daily from Yangon . But there are not many people around to enjoy the sights. Reportedly, foreigners and investors aren't keen to visit, especially amid travel agent reports that the area may be 'dangerous,' and foreign aid workers who have visited the city in an official capacity are apparently so spooked by the eerie emptiness that they prefer to commute in daily from Yangon. Despite the fact that the government set aside almost 5 acres of land each for foreign embassies and headquarters of UN missions, only the Bangladeshi embassy has moved to Naypyidaw so far.","The Burmese capital was moved from Yangon (Rangoon) to Naypyidaw, inexplicably, about a decade ago .

Helicopter cameras caught a swarm of cops kicking and punching 30-year-old Francis Pusok more than 80 times on Thursday, after he fled his southern California home when they tried to arrest him for identity theft charges. In an interview with NBC 4 on Monday,  Pusok revealed that he had been handcuffed for '99 per cent' of the beating and that near the end of the scarring experience a deputy whispered into his ear 'This isn't over'. Scroll down for video . Scarring experience: Francis Pusok (left) spoke for the first time on Monday, four days after he was beaten up by cops in footage taken from a helicopter. His girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, pictured center . When San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies arrived at Pusok's house on Thursday, he said he  fled 'because any contact with police has been negative for me'. As the chase was coming to a close about two and a half hours later, video shows Pusok falling to the ground as he is hit with a taser and two deputies approach. The officers then start to assault Pusok, and later claimed that his taser had been ineffective due to his loose clothing - even though Pusok is clearly seen convulsing from the electric shock in the helicopter footage. On the run: Pusok fled his house in San Bernardino County on Thursday after Sheriff's deputies showed up to arrest him on identity theft charges. He led police on a more than two-hour long chase, part of it on horseback . On the ground: At the end of the chase, police officers shot Pusok with a taser and he fell to the ground. Pusok claims they handcuffed him within 15 seconds and then continued to beat him despite the fact he was lying helpless on the ground . Cruel: The helicopter continued to record the first two cops beating Pusok up as more deputies swooped in . Under investigation: In the aftermath of the disturbing video, 10 officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated . Pusok estimates that within 15 seconds of the first taser hit, the cops had him in handcuffs but says they continued to assault him and yelled 'stop resisting' even though he was laying face down on the ground. He says the officers went on to tase him two more times after he was in handcuffs. Pusok remembers the cops 'hitting me every place that they could hit me - anywhere and everywhere.' 'I thought I was being beaten to death,' said Pusok.. 'I was wondering, ""When is it going to stop?""' Bruised: Pusok sports a painful black eye in his booking photo. He was released from jail on Sunday . After the incident, Pusok was arrested on suspicion of evading, stolen property, reckless driving and theft of a horse. He was treated for his injuries while being held at West Valley Detention Center where he was released Sunday night at bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for June 16, but San Bernardino County Prosecutors said Monday that they had not yet made a decision on whether to file formal charges against Pusok. Meanwhile, 10 officers - including a sergeant and a detective - involved in the incident have been placed on paid leave as the FBI starts an investigation into whether excessive force was used in the arrest. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said last week that he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. In his interview on Monday, Pusok said he thinks his prior run-ins with police may have sparked their violent backlash. Indeed, Pusok's lengthy criminal record includes charges of obstructing an officer and resisting an officer, as well as attempted robbery, animal cruelty and fighting or offensive words. Deputies have been called to Pusok's home before, during which he threatened to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of his family, Sheriff McMhaon said. Disturbing: San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon says he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that he has launched an internal investigation . However, Pusok's pregnant girlfriend, Jolene Bindner, says some of the prior charges against her longtime partner have been trumped up. Bindner told NBC that the charges he threatened to kill a police officer are 'absolutely not true. I was there the whole time.' She also said that Pusok, father of their three children, was arrested in 2002 for driving at unsafe speed on a sidewalk but that he was only riding a bicycle at the time. What concerns Bindner the most though was the one deputy's alleged whispered threat of 'This isn't over' at the end of the beating. 'That concerns me because we have children together and I don't want any kind of retaliation against me or my children,' she said. Doing better: After visiting her longtime partner in jail on Sunday, Pusok's girlfriend Jolene Bindner said he was on the road to recovery . Threats: The couple share three children together and have another on the way. Bindner (left) says she is concerned about a deputy who whispered 'This is not over' to her boyfriend at the end of the beating . Pusok's attorney Jim Terrell said his client's criminal history has nothing to do with any possible excessive force case. 'If it wasn't for that helicopter and the camera...they would be charging him with 10 counts of battering a police officer,' Terrell said. 'That's how it rolls here, that's what goes on every single day.' Pusok's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder. The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and applauding McMahon's call for an investigation.","Francis Pusok, 30, was arrested Thursday after a hours long chase with police in San Bernardino County, California .

The 30-year-old becomes only the third player in Madrid's history to achieve the feat and a breakdown of the statistics demonstrate just how relentless a goalscorer he is. Sevilla appear to be his favourite opponents, with Ronaldo netting an astonishing 18 times against them since signing for Madrid in 2009.

The pair are second on the Portugal international's Madrid hit-list, alongside Getafe. The stats also show Ronaldo's impressive eye for a goal in the final moments of a game, netting an astonishing 61 times between minutes 76 and 90. Over half (161) of his Madrid goals have been scored at the Santiago Bernabeu and he has also found the net 60 times in the Champions League for the club.

443,d8aee1ae4b1130afbf0572a49afc2f5366b181c9,"(CNN)Rebekah Gregory blinked back tears as she thought about the verdict. It had been almost two years since Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother planted bombs at the Boston Marathon, setting off deadly explosions that wounded her and hundreds of others. In court last month, she testified that one of the blasts on that day in 2013 left her lying in the street, staring at her own bones. Now, jurors have found him guilty on all 30 counts he faced for the deadly bombings and their aftermath. But no verdict can ever totally make up for the pain, she said. ""I don't believe that there will ever be justice brought to this, no mater if he does get the death penalty or he remains in prison for the rest of his life,"" she said, crying as she spoke to reporters outside her Texas home. ""I do believe, however, that he should be held accountable for his actions. And I'm very thankful for each of the jury members that are making him do that."" Gregory, who wrote a widely publicized letter to Tsarnaev after testifying, said the trial has left her and other victims reeling from a flood of emotions as they relive horrifying memories, but it's an important step. ""Everything is being brought up again full force. Our lives will never ever be the same, but I hope with this we can move forward and remember that we are still here for a reason, that there's a bigger plan,"" she said. ""I may be standing on one fake leg, but I'm standing here, stronger than ever, because someone tried to destroy me, and he failed."" For Gregory and others who lived through the 2013 attack, Wednesday's verdict brought a mix of emotions, from triumphant vows to move forward, to expressions of gratitude, to debate over whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death. There were no outbursts inside the federal courthouse in Boston. In fact, there was barely any peripheral noise as people sat on the edges of their seats. As Tsarnaev fidgeted and scratched the back of his head, some survivors and victims' family members lowered their heads and dabbed tears. As CNN's Alexandra Field noted from inside the courtroom, ""They've waited a long time for this."" The family of Sean Collier, a 26-year-old police officer shot to death in his patrol car on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, were terrorists who ""failed monumentally"" in striking fear in people. ""While today's verdict can never bring Sean back, we are thankful that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families,"" the Collier family said in a written statement. To Richard ""Dic"" Donohue, an MBTA police officer left in a pool of blood after being wounded in a shootout with the Tsarnaevs in Watertown, the verdicts show that ""as a society, ... terrorism will not prevail, and we will hold those accountable for their acts against our nation."" ""Justice has been served today,"" Donahue tweeted. Survivor Karen Brassard said she needed to attend the trial to help her heal. She doesn't believe Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's brother Tamerlan, now dead, persuaded him to take part in the plot, as the defense contended. Dzhokhar, in her view, was ""all in."" ""Obviously we are grateful for the outcome today,"" Brassard tolder reporters. ""It's not a happy occasion, but it's something that we can put one more step behind us."" That sense of turning the page was echoed by Bruce Mendelsohn, who is among those who rushed to save lives at the marathon finish line. The verdicts mean that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is no longer a bombing suspect -- he is now officially a ""convicted killer."" You can't call it celebration. But there is a newfound peace of mind, at least, in and around Boston. This was a community that suffered greatly after the bombing and subsequent manhunt. And they got through it by rallying around each other, a deep bond reflected in the mantra ""Boston Strong."" That feeling was reaffirmed all around the city by Wednesday's verdict. And it's evident in people like Heather Abbott, who lost her left leg below the knee. Since then, she's become a living example of someone who wasn't stopped by the terror -- learning not only to walk again, but to run again. ""Nothing can ever replace the lives that were lost or changed forever,"" Abbott said Wednesday on Facebook. ""But at least there is some relief in knowing that justice is served and responsibility will be taken."" That view was commonly shared. For those hurt -- physically, mentally, emotionally -- by the horrors of 2013, Wednesday was key to their progression. But it's not the end of the road. Just ask Jeff Bauman. The picture of him, bloodied, being rushed through the streets of Boston by good Samaritan Carlos Arredondo, became a symbol of the carnage and heroism from this attack. Even after losing both his legs, Bauman has become a symbol since of resilience -- moving on with his life, by marrying and fathering a child. On Wednesday, Bauman said the verdict ""will never replace the lives that were lost and so dramatically changed."" ""But it is a relief,"" he added, ""and one step closer to closure."" CNN's Ann O'Neill and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Survivor Jeff Bauman stresses ""we will never replace the lives that were lost""

444,3f450f3cb034319e8e398e1b9d64399565a7b60a,"A drunken Alaskan man was arrested after he stole a forklift to retrieve his pickup truck which he'd crashed. Aleksandr Glushko, 21, of Delta Junction  drove for more than three miles while intoxicated to retrieve the truck he'd just crashed. But his bright idea turned sour when an Alaskan Railroad worker spotted him at the wheel of the forklift driving by the crash site, according to The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. Bad idea: The pickup truck driven by Aleksandr Glushko is pictured here after he crashed it in Fairbanks, Alaska, police said the 21-year-old  drove a stolen forklift more than three miles while intoxicated to retrieve it . The railroad worker informed police that he had just seen a man driving a forklift to Illinois Street and the driver had told him he was taking the forklift to get his dad’s truck, which had a flat tire. However, he was arrested by police who were at the scene when he looped back. He has been charged with a felony for driving under the influence of alcohol. According to police, the bizarre incident unfolded just before 6 a.m. Monday, when Glushko  drove off the road in a pickup and crashed into pipe stacked in a company yard. The pickup was left straddling the pipe. Police said Glushko then walked to George Horner Ice Park, where he stole a forklift and drove off with it. Lieutenant Matt Soden from Fairbanks Police Department told the newspaper: 'Police were on scene talking to the railroad worker when Mr. Glushko came driving back up on the forklift.' Glushko was cooperative and agreed to take a breath-alcohol test. It registered 0.230, almost three times the intoxication standard of 0.08, Soden said. He has two prior DUI convictions and was arrested on charges of felony DUI and vehicle theft. He remained in jail Tuesday.","Aleksandr Glushko, 21,  drove for more than three miles while intoxicated .

Hamilton, the world champion, was relaxed and delighted having taken pole but Rosberg, his team-mate, was grim-faced, demoralised and made his first public criticism of his team. Nico Rosberg will start behind pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel third on the grid in China . Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs . Rosberg was only four-hundredths of a second behind the Briton and will start second on the grid. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari is third, nearly a second adrift of Hamilton. But Rosberg was visibly angry after the Mercedes pit-wall brains put him under unnecessary ‘pressure’. The German was the last driver out for his final flying lap, meaning he had to rush to get in a competitive time. Rosberg, who is customarily gracious in defeat, fell slightly short of Hamilton’s mark and was grumpy afterwards. He said: ‘It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don’t think it cost me anything, but even the mind-set to know that I have to speed up a bit — we need to look into that. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for Sunday's race in Shanghai . The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season . ‘Other than that the lap was good  and it is very annoying as the lap is never perfect, so four hundredths is always in it. Tyre degradation is going to be a big issue for the race as we are going to take the tyres right to the limit. So there are many opportunities.’ Poor old Rosberg was cock of the walk in the early and middle parts of last season, but he seems terribly lacklustre since Hamilton won the title. Even his Mercedes boss, Niki Lauda, said he should ‘sort himself out’ — a statement on Rosberg’s psyche rather than his work ethic. Whether he has the speed to match Hamilton may be at the centre of his anger. The Briton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently. McLaren will again be towards the back of the grid with Jenson Button 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the former champions. Button said: ‘I guess we hoped we might be just a bit closer than we were today. In practice, we’d looked a bit more competitive, certainly. ‘We’d found a reasonably good balance with the car, in fact, but the lap-time isn’t quite there yet.’ Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China .","Nico Rosberg was the last driver out of the pit-lane and was forced to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked ahead of his final shot at pole .

Diana’s final wishes for the disposal of her £21.4 million estate are among a vast archive of wills dating back to 1858 now available to view online. Those of Winston Churchill and George Orwell can also be seen. In her will, Diana’s butler Paul Burrell was bequeathed the sum of £50,000, free of inheritance tax. Scroll down for video . The will of Princess Diana is among 41 million available to order at the click of a button thanks to a new service . Possessions including paintings and a clock were distributed among her 17 godchildren, while the rest went to her sons William and Harry. Qadir Ahmed runs the secure Iron Mountain facility in a leafy suburb of Birmingham where row upon row of the documents are kept in temperature-controlled storage, under tight security. He said the wills are a fascinating snapshot into the personalities and characters of people from every walk of life. For some, having a copy of a will is a matter of sentimentality, whereas others - particularly in the case of celebrities - are ordered out of 'pure curiosity', he said. 'We have 41 million in storage and there are so many fascinating and emotional stories,' said Mr Ahmed. One such is that of the late Paul Hunter, the champion snooker player, who died of cancer in 2006 aged just 27. Paul Burrell was given £50,000 by Diana when she died . The Yorkshireman fathered a daughter who, at the time he penned his will, was not yet born but she is remembered in the passages of his will, as Mr Ahmed describes. 'There are some really touching stories inside these files - people like Paul Hunter, who in his will says 'To my unborn child, I leave ...' and that is genuinely touching. 'He believed at the time he was writing this will, that he wouldn't survive the birth of his child.' 'You feel the emotion of that moment, through reading the record.' The first disbursement of Diana's will reads: 'I bequeath to my butler Paul Burrell the sum of £50,000, free of inheritance tax.' It also provides for specified keepsakes including watercolour paintings and a carriage clock to be distributed among her 17 godchildren, while to Princes William and Harry she left everything else. In the event of her death she makes express provision the Prince of Wales 'will consult with my mother [Frances Shand Kydd] with regard to the upbringing, education and welfare of our children'. She also makes clear her wish to be buried. Mr Ahmed said the new system, which has been in place since the end of last year, means people no longer have to order wills by post, or by heading to their local Registry Office. 'A lot of the public are not aware these are public records,' he said. 'Once someone goes through probate, that's it. It's a simple process, through the gov.uk website. 'You can pay a small fee of £10 and order a record of anyone who's gone through probate, searching by the person's name and year of death.' Among the other celebrity wills, are those of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, creator of Winnie the Pooh AA Milne and George Orwell - under his real name Eric Blair - who penned 1984. Data centre manager Qadir Ahmed inspects one of the more than 41 million public wills held in secure storage at the Iron Mountain facility in Birmingham . Churchill, who died in 1965, left an estate worth £266,054 which he asked to be divided between his wife and children. He gave his country home Chartwell, in Kent, to the National Trust to be a museum after his death. As well as other bequests of cash to his wife, children, family and friends, he also left money to his employees, including £100 for his gardener. His son-in-law, Arthur Christopher John Soames, was given 'such of my brood mares, followers and fillies' from Churchill's stable, but with the caveat his choices were ""not exceeding three in number, nor £7,500 in total value'. Also stored away is the will of wartime code-breaker Alan Turing, recently played in Hollywood movie The Imitation Game by Benedict Cumberbatch. Turing's brief final testament directs his possessions be left to close friends and his mother. Meanwhile, Orwell - listed under his birth name Blair - left instructions 'no biography be written' and 'no memorial service be held for me after my death'.","Diana's will is among those stored in an archive which is to be put online .

""The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year,"" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's Secretary General in a release. ""It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence."" The report, ""Death Sentences and Executions 2014,"" cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its ""Strike Hard"" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. ""The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide),"" Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. ""A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition."" While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, ""against scores of people in some cases."" The organization found ""positive developments"" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences . Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. ""Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments,"" Gaughran said. ""Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region."" The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes ""thousands"" of prisoners each year, ""more than the rest of the world put together."" The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. ""In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards,"" the report stated. ""In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka."" The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. ""The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another,"" he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. ""We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights."" Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.","Amnesty's annual death penalty report catalogs encouraging signs, but setbacks in numbers of those sentenced to death .

451,040ce133116f80d53a2a6333bf81fe07556ab93b,"(CNN)By now, you probably have a position regarding the controversy over Indiana's religious freedom law. You applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, using religion as a cover. Or, like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states. The issue drives a wedge because, well, the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated, but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned. Whichever side you're on, here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy. These points might not change your mind, but offer context to better understand the uproar. As the author of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Sen. Chuck Schumer is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding Indiana's version of the law. Schumer mocks Indiana's contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22-year-old federal law. ""That may be true only if you're using a Funhouse mirror,"" Schumer wrote on his Facebook page. The federal law was intended to protect individual's religious freedom from government intervention, he said. The Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom, he contends. Also, the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals, while the Indiana law also protects private companies, Schumer said. So, how can the law's supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law? If you look at the purpose of the law, the language in the federal and Indiana religious freedom laws are indeed  nearly indistinguishable. In short --  the government cannot interfere with a person's religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so. The uproar is over that fact that the Indiana law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved. Other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- Indiana became the 20th. But other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the Indiana law does. The key difference in the Indiana law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense. This is how it could make a difference: . In 2006, Vanessa Willock contacted a photographer about shooting her commitment ceremony with her partner. This was in New Mexico, a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute. The company, Elane Photography, refused the job because of the co-owner's religious beliefs. Willock sued Elane Photography for discrimination, and the company defended itself by citing the law. The photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity. What would happen if that case happened today in Indiana, with the new, expanded religious freedom law? For sure, the case would have proceeded to trial, said Tim Holbrook, a law professor at Emory University. The photography studio would have had the chance to make its argument in court that it denied the service because of religious reasons. Would the outcome have been the same? Would an Indiana jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation? In a letter expressing concern about the Indiana law, a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what Indiana has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns. ""In our expert opinion, the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state RFRA will more likely create confusion, conflict, and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in Indiana while undermining the state's ability to enforce other compelling interests,"" the letter, whose signatories included many Indiana law professors, stated. These concerns are based on speculation of what might happen, said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law. Yes, the Indiana law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense, he said. ""But, just because you raise the defense does not mean it will be successful."" Those who try to defend their discriminatory actions in court tend to lose, Blackman said. In his opinion, if Elane Photography had been able to use the law as a defense in New Mexico, it still likely would have lost the case. What's clear is that Indiana's law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom. The success of such arguments is to be seen. In the meantime, some are already hatching plans on how to test the law, including Bill Levin, founder of The First Church Of Cannabis, who argued on CNN that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. Much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by President Bill Clinton more than 20  years ago. There was bipartisan support in 1993, so why the commotion over a similar law in 2015, some ask? Context, timing and intent have changed the way these laws are viewed. The federal law was written by two Democrats, Schumer and the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. Today, it is being championed by Republicans. The law came into being after two Native Americans in Oregon were fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic because they had consumed peyote, the hallucinogenic cactus. They were denied unemployment benefits, and they sued the state, claiming that the peyote was part of their religious customs. They lost the case. There was outrage over the decision, and the law was created as a remedy. As envisioned by its authors, it would protect the freedoms of religious minorities. Over the years, the law helped a number of people -- a Muslim prisoner won the right to grow a short beard, a Santeria priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions, and a Native American boy received an exception to his school's policy banning long hair on boys. The law was on the books for years, with little attention paid to it. But Holbrook says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps. Many states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow Christians to deny services to same-sex couples. Holbrook said. ""The timing is beyond a coincidence,"" he said. ""We are having an interest in RFRA at the time same-sex marriage is coming forward."" Though not enshrined in the law, critics accuse the states pursuing the laws of using them to justify discrimination by the majority religion. Blackman said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination. The expanded laws might mean more people will defend themselves using it, but most will likely lose, he said. ""The moral outrage over this reflects how uninformed people are on the history of the RFRA,"" he said. So we've established that the biggest difference between the federal law and the Indiana law is the scope: In Indiana, the law can be raised as a defense in private disputes, while the federal law applies only to government matters. Not so fast. According to Blackman, the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform. Four U.S. circuit courts of appeals have ruled that the federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties. Two other appeals courts have ruled that this is not allowed. And then, there is the Hobby Lobby case. Hobby Lobby, citing the federal religious freedom law, argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via Obamacare because it was against the owners' beliefs. And, Hobby Lobby won the case before the Supreme Court. The ruling, in effect, expanded the reach of the federal law to include a business. The Hobby Lobby decision, plus the appeals courts rulings, may have opened the door for states like Indiana to be explicit about its expansion of the law. One way to look at it, Blackman said, is that Indiana simply clarified and codified something that is hazy in the federal courts. The outrage over the Indiana law is that it can be used to deny services to the LGBT community on the ground of religious beliefs. Some may rightfully ask, ""Where was the outrage before the religious freedom law?"" Indiana does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In that sense, the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Even before the controversial Indiana law was passed, if a restaurant denied service to a gay couple, the couple might be able to sue, but not for discrimination. For that matter, there is also no federal law that protects the LGBT community. According to the Human Rights Campaign, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are sometimes fired, denied a promotion or harassed in the workplace. And their recourse is limited. With the proliferation of religious freedom state laws, nondiscrimination laws become even more important. Another hypothetical outcome of the New Mexico case involving the lesbian couple and the photography studio. If New Mexico had the same religious freedom law as Indiana, the case would have gone to trial. But New Mexico has a nondiscrimination law that protects the LGBT community, it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim. In Indiana, that protection would be lacking. (It gets more complicated when some local governments, like the city of Indianapolis, do have nondiscrimination ordinances). For this reason, Holbrook suggests that a ""fix"" for the Indiana law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law. Or, at the very least, an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination.","The controversy over Indiana's religious freedom law is complicated .

Paula Dunican spent £25 on the baby blue coat at her local branch in Canterbury, Kent. But when the 49-year-old took it home to try on, she noticed a dark stain 'seeping through' from the its lining. Inside, a four inch-long gecko was flattened, its scales imprinted onto the fabric. Paula Dunican was horrified when she found the body of a crushed lizard on the lining of a £25 coat from Asda . 'I noticed the coat had a stain on the back seeping through, so I opened it and stuck to the lining was a shrivelled, squashed lizard,' said Mrs Dunican. 'I think it must have been ironed - it was disgusting.' The supermarket has offered her a refund and £40 voucher, adding that the reptile may have climbed into one of the boxes transporting clothes from Vietnam where they are made. Its quality control department said it was waiting for Mrs Dunican, who is a school learning support assistant, to return the garment. In 2012 another Asda customer found a dead cockroach inside a kettle she had bought to sterilise baby items. Mrs Dunican said the reptile looked as though it had been ironed onto the coat. A spokesman for Asda apologised and offered her a £40 voucher and refund . Carly Wintle bought the own brand appliance in Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, and found the insect inside after unwrapping it. Meanwhile in February a disgusted shopper found the severed head of a frozen rat in a bag of frozen spinach. Terri Powis, 33, was horrified when she opened the bag and found the rodent's decomposing body. The supermarket apologised and asked her to return the item to the store, acting, she said, as though it happened 'every day', the Mirror reported.","Paula Dunican paid £25 for the baby blue coat at her local branch of Asda .

Scientists detected the complex organic molecules in a disk of gas and dust around a star 455 light years away where planets are likely to be forming. The discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on Earth are not unique to our solar system. Scientists detected the complex organic molecules in a disc of gas around an infant star 455 light years away where planets are likely to be forming. The discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on Earth are not unique to our solar system . Radio telescope observations showed the disk surrounding the million-year-old star MWC 480 to be 'brimming' with the complex carbon-based molecule methyl cyanide. Both this molecule and its simpler organic cousin hydrogen cyanide were identified in the cold outer reaches of the newly formed disc. The region can be compared with our solar system's Kuiper Belt, a realm of icy mini-worlds and comets beyond Neptune. Experts believe comets and asteroids from the outer solar system seeded the young Earth with water and organic molecules to set the stage for life to evolve. Astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (Alma), a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in Chile's Atacama desert, to investigate MWC 480. Alma's high sensitivity antennae have now shown that such molecules not only form and survive, but thrive . Astronomer Dr Karin Oberg, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Massachusetts, said: 'Studies of comets and asteroids show that the solar nebula that spawned our sun and planets was rich in water and complex organic compounds. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, (pictured) There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy – and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington yesterday, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa. 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Jeffery Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' 'We now have evidence that this same chemistry exists elsewhere in the universe, in regions that could form solar systems not unlike our own.' The molecules surrounding MWC 480 have been detected in similar concentrations in our own solar system's comets, she pointed out. The star, which is about twice as massive as the sun, lies in a well-studied star-forming region in the constellation Taurus. Astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (Alma), a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in Chile's Atacama desert, to investigate MWC 480. Previously it was unclear whether complex organic molecules commonly survive the shocks and radiation levels found in a newly forming solar system . Alma's high sensitivity antennae have now shown that such molecules not only form and survive, but thrive. The findings, reported in the journal Nature, reveal that there is enough methyl cyanide around MWC 480 to fill all of the Earth's oceans. Among complex organic molecules, cyanides - especially methyl cyanide - are important because they contain carbon-nitrogen bonds essential for the formation of amino acids, the components of proteins. As the MWC 480 system evolves it is likely that organic molecules locked away in comets and other icy bodies will be ferried closer to the star where conditions may be suitable for life, the scientists believe. Dr Oberg added: 'From the study of exoplanets, we know our solar system isn't unique in having rocky planets and an abundance of water. 'Now we know we're not unique in organic chemistry. Once more, we have learned that we're not special. From a life in the universe point of view, this is great news.'","Million-year-old star MWC 480 is 'brimming' with carbon-based molecules .

David Cameron will today risk infuriating the SNP by vowing to conduct an annual review of the fairness of the Scottish government’s policies on the rest of the UK. A Conservative government would create a new principle to ensure decisions by Holyrood do not have an ‘unforeseen detrimental effect’ for people south of the border, he will say. The Prime Minister will tell voters in England that new powers for the Scottish Parliament mean it ‘can now have a big impact on your job, your income, and investment in your area’. Mr Cameron will call the idea the ‘Carlisle Principle’ – named to reflect the sort of border communities in the rest of the UK that could be particularly badly affected by decisions taken by the Scottish government. There has been growing resentment in England and Wales at the ‘apartheid’ between those living north and south of the border in areas such as healthcare and university fees. For instance, cancer drugs have been made available on the NHS in Scotland that are not prescribed elsewhere, meaning taxpayers in England and Wales are contributing to funding them, but not benefiting. The Scottish Parliament’s new powers to cut air passenger duty could lead to air travellers and airports in the north of England being unfairly disadvantaged – and require targeted tax cuts, Mr Cameron will say. However, Scottish Nationalists are likely to accuse Mr Cameron of wanting Westminster to ‘mark the Scottish Parliament’s homework’ every year. He will also be accused of seeking to stoke anti-Scottish sentiment in the rest of the UK – and throwing fuel on the fire of Scottish nationalism. The Tory manifesto promises to introduce a principle of ‘English votes for English laws’, meaning English MPs will be given a veto over legislation relating solely to England. Under Mr Cameron’s latest plan, a formal assessment would be made by the Treasury and Cabinet Office each year of the impact of Scottish policies, including tax rates, business levies, university tuition fees and healthcare. Mr Cameron risks the wrath of Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon (pictured above) with his announcement . The Chancellor will tell MPs ‘what action is needed to make sure there is no detriment to the rest of the country’. The Prime Minister, on a campaign visit to the North West, will insist the plan will not stop the Scottish government taking the decisions it wants. ‘In the Scottish referendum, we made a clear promise to devolve more powers to the Scottish Parliament,’ Mr Cameron will say. ‘After we won that referendum, we kept our promise, and agreement was reached – for the first time – between all five of Scotland’s major parties to give the Scottish Parliament extensive new powers. ‘But as we go further in devolving powers to Scotland, we need to make sure devolution works for all the other all parts of this country too. ‘Today I want to set out a new principle – you could call it the Carlisle Principle – that we will make sure that there are no unforeseen detrimental consequences to the rest of the country from Scottish devolution.’ Boris Johnson and Sir John Major will enter the election fray this week as the Tories try to bolster their campaign. Sir John will warn of the dangers of a Labour-SNP government. The ex-premier could be deployed to speak as early as tomorrow. Later in the week, David Cameron is due to make a first high-profile campaign appearance with Mr Johnson. There are growing calls from Tory MPs for the London mayor to be ‘weaponised’. David Cameron has revealed he is locked in a high stakes battle: over ear-piercing. While contesting a general election campaign, he is also in a 'fight' with eldest daughter Nancy about when she can have her ears pierced. The Prime Minister also admitted he does not want his children to follow wife Samantha in having tattoo. In an interview with the Sun, Mr Cameron said his children 'take the mickey out of me daily', including mocking his TV and music choices. 'To them I'm just a normal dad, who they think is a bit square and sometimes embarrassing. It's very sobering to come home to after a day in the office,' he said. 'They rib me about, you know, anything from my CD collection to what I watch on TV.' Nancy is due to start secondary school in September, and wants to have her ears pierced. Mr Cameron said: 'I'm in that fight with Nancy at the moment. We'll probably reach an agreement over what age she can have them done. We're in negotiations.' His wife Samantha has a small tattoo of a dolphin on her right ankle, which she had done while travelling as a student. She has said it would 'fine' if her children copied her. But Mr Cameron said: 'I'm not a big fan. I love Samantha's tattoo, it's very small, very discreet. But I'd be a square dad and tell the children to think very carefully about it.'","A Tory government would create a new principle to review SNP policies .

When the Washington couple's three-year-old had first began complaining of someone talking to him at night, his parents had put it down to their toddler's over-active imagination, reported CBS New York. That was until one night when they heard a strange man's voice come over the monitor to tell their son: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you.' A couple heard the terrifying message: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you' come through their 3-year-old son's baby monitor (stock image) And the horrified parents, who do not want to be named for fear the unknown man could track them down, believe it is not just the audio monitor that has been hacked. They believe the stranger has also got into the camera on the device. After the first creepy message, the boy's mother had walked into the room and overheard the hacker saying, 'Look someone's coming' or 'Someone's coming into view.' The mother said she broke down in tears after the realization hit home that a total stranger was able to control the camera to watch their son and spy on them. The stranger had managed to hack the baby monitor and the family says the hacker was even able to remotely control the camera on the monitor (stock image) She told CBS New York: 'Well, I started to cry in there, because it all started coming back to me, and I started figuring things out.' They reported the incident to Foscam, the company where they bought their monitor, who admitted it was possible the device's cameras were being controlled remotely but they could not say from where. Technology experts have now warned that it is becoming easier for hackers to infiltrate family's baby monitors as many of the newer devices connect to the internet. 'It's basically like they're standing next to you in your house,' Lance Ulanoff, chief correspondent for the digital media website Mashable,CBS. He warned that parents should change the passwords on the devices to make it more difficult for people to guess. Because some new baby monitors connect to the internet and come with a smartphone app, it has become easier for hackers to infiltrate them and listen in or speak to children . 'If somebody else has your login information, they can go to that same app, and log into your webcam, which is what happened here,' Ulanoff said. Earlier this month, another couple - this time from Rochester, Minnesota - discovered their baby monitors and cameras had been infiltrated after they found footage from the nanny cam posted online, according to Redbook. They first became suspicious after they heard music coming in from their baby's room. 'We were sleeping in bed, and basically heard music coming from the nursery, but then when we went into the room the music turned off,' she told KTTC. When she tracked down the IP address which was streaming the music, she found a web link to a page with thousands of pictures from baby monitors all over the world, including several from her own child's nursery. 'There's at least fifteen different countries listed and it's not just nurseries—it's people's living rooms, their bedrooms, their kitchens,' she explained. 'Every place that people think is sacred and private in their home is being accessed.'","Washington couple's son began complaining of someone talking to him .

The man, known only as Xu, even tried to impregnate the 'daughter-in-law' himself after discovering his son had not slept with his wife a single time. Xu is currently under arrest for human trafficking by the police of Lianyungang city in eastern China, according to the People's Daily Online. Desperate for a grandchild, Xu (pictured) bought a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties . Xu and his son live outside Yancheng, a city of 1.6 million in eastern China. Hoping for a grandchild to carry on the bloodline, he spent 12,000 yuan (£1,311) purchasing a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties, through a middleman at the beginning of 2014. It's reported that the young bride, known only as Wang, is also mentally impaired. Six months after Wang 'married' into the family, Xu discovered that the young couple had not slept together at all. Desperate to have a 'grandson', Xu decided to have sex with her himself. After spending six months trying to get Wang pregnant, he realised that the young bride was likely to be infertile. The wife (pictured), known as Wang, was resold to another family after failing to get pregnant . Worrying that Wang, whose mental health was getting worse, might be a drain to the family without 'any concrete contribution', Xu sold her off to another family through a middleman in his village for 10,000 yuan (£1,093). The astonishing incident only emerged after a regular home visit by the community policemen at Guanyun County. The local policemen discovered the incident while paying a visit to the family who bought Wang from Xu . 'We asked her (Wang) name and age, but she couldn't answer,' said Gao Ming, a policeman at Guanyun County police station. This put Gao and his colleagues on alert and it took them two weeks to find out how Wang had been trafficked into the village.

Dawn arrived on 6 March, the first time a spacecraft has orbited a dwarf planet, and is now preparing for the key science phase of the mission. However, the images have not yet revealed what the mystery ‘bright spots’ on the surface of the world are, which have gripped the attention of scientists and the public alike. Nasa scientists in California have released new images of Ceres (shown). They were taken by the Dawn spacecraft from a distance of 21,000 miles (33,000km). The spacecraft is beginning to move closer and closer to Ceres. And it will soon study the whole planet - including its mystery bright spots . The latest images were taken on 10 April from a distance of 21,000 miles (33,000km), and are the highest-resolution views of Ceres so far. The spacecraft is currently on the side of the planet that is mostly shrouded in darkness, but over the coming months it will see more of the world in light. And it will also see Ceres in better and a higher resolution. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. It is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star, allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres because it is seen as being a record of the early solar system, and may also have shifting ice on its surface. Ceres is the largest body in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with an average diameter of 590 miles (950km). Dawn has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid Vesta in 2012. Its first ‘science orbit’ will begin on 23 April, with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) away until 9 May. After this, it will begin making lower and lower orbits to get better views of the surface. The mission will allow scientists to study the last major body between Earth and Jupiter that has yet to be explored. 'The mission is so exciting, because we're exploring the last uncharted world of the solar system,' Dr Marc Rayman, Dawn chief engineer and mission director at JPL told MailOnline. 'For me the opportunity to travel to this distant alien world that has been known of for two centuries, a mysterious world of rock and ice, perhaps with subsurface liquid water maybe stored as ponds, lakes or oceans, is very exciting.' Shown above is an animation of Ceres rotating as Dawn observed its north pole. Ceres is about 2.8 times further from the sun than Earth, and a day on the dwarf planet lasts nine Earth hours. Credit: Nasa . Dawn (artist's illustration shown) has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid Vesta in 2012. Its first ‘science orbit’ will begin on 23 April, with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) away until 9 May . In the next few weeks and months, the dwarf planet will be studied in great detail. But the most impressive images will be returned in December, when Dawn starts one of its lowest science orbits. It will be at an altitude of just 225 miles (360km) above the surface - below the orbital height of the International Space Station around Earth - allowing it to get high resolution images of the surface. The primary science mission for the spacecraft will last until June 2016 - by which the team expects to have achieved all of its scientific goals -and it is unlikely the spacecraft will be extended beyond that date, as it will probably start running out of fuel by then. This map-projected view of Ceres was created from images taken by Nasa's Dawn spacecraft during its initial approach to the dwarf planet, prior to being captured into orbit in March 2015. Differences in morphology and color across the surface suggest Ceres was once an active body . Perhaps of most interest, though, are the mystery bright spots on the surface. These are thought to possibly be expanses of ice inside a crater on Ceres. Based on new infrared images released by Nasa the other day, it appears that the pair of spots have different thermal properties - suggesting they have different origins. They could also be towering ‘water volcanoes’, but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this. 'The bright spots continue to fascinate the science team, but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source,' said Chris Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles. These images, from Dawn's visible and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR), highlight two regions on Ceres containing bright spots.

458,13dc5143ca8906b56973cfd58b19d1c61762e071,"Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon has long been a fortress with no team scoring there in the Champions League for 663 minutes. Last season the now Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was the reason for that but now the man keeping the clean sheets is Jan Oblak. Sportsmail looks at the 22-year-old who has made Atletico fans forget about Courtois... and David De Gea. No one knew too much about him last season outside of Portugal and Slovenia so was it a gamble? You only have to look at his price tag to see how highly-rated he was. He cost €16million (£11.5m) and that is a La Liga record for a goalkeeper. The 22-year-old was already Slovenia's number one when he left Benfica for Madrid in the summer. With experienced goalkeepers such as Petr Cech and Pepe Reina potentially available, going for a young relatively untried keeper looked a gamble but he already looks to have been money well spent. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a big save to deny Gareth Bale in the early minutes . Oblak gets down low to keep out a shot from Real Madrid's James Rodriguez in the second half . A success right from the start of the season? No. Simeone likes to ease in new signings especially when they are young and 31-year-old Miguel Moya was signed from Getafe in the close season as back-up. But the back-up became first choice because Oblak had a right hip injury in pre-season and wasn't 100 per cent when the campaign started. Moya played in the league with Oblak coming in for Champions League games but in his first match in Europe he conceded three goals from three shots. He has recovered brilliantly and now the clamour is for him to start all matches. Cristiano Ronaldo is thwarted in his attempt to open the scoring against rivals Atletico Madrid . He has convinced everyone in Madrid? Simeone's number two Mono Burgos is a big fan. The Argentine is a former Atletico keeper and although he doesn't train the goalkeepers he is convinced Atletico have found someone who can keep goal for them for years to come. Pablo Vercellone who is the club's keeping coach is just as excited and even Iker Casillas is a fan. The Real Madrid keeper said after Tuesday's game: 'He was fantastic in the first 45 minutes. We deserved more reward from all the chances we had but we didn't get it because he played so well.' Oblak put in an impressive performance for Atletico against their great rivals Madrid on Tuesday . And it really was a very special first half. Atletico have not allowed a team to get six shots on target in one half of football all season but he stopped them all. He also made two more stops in the second half when most of the football was being played at the other end and he had to stay awake. Has he fitted into the dressing room? He speaks some English, some Portuguese, and some Spanish so he can make himself understood without problems. Still only 22 and living his first year in Spain he is predictably introverted but has a strong enough personality to impose himself on his defence. Oblak  stops Bale's attempt on goal during the Champions League quarter-final first leg on Tuesday . Other strengths? We saw the shot stopping on Wednesday but his distribution is also a weapon for Atletico. They were camped in their own half in the first 45 minutes against Real unable to get their passing going. Oblak's long – and importantly accurate – throws and kicks forward to Mario Mandzukic were an important release. How good can he become? So good he'll be sold? Atletico have already lost two brilliant keepers in De Gea who they could only keep for one season and Courtois who they were not able to take from Chelsea. They will not want to lost Oblak and with foreign investment from the Wanda group in China the club does not have to sell it's best players – he's at Atletico for good. Atletico lost two brilliant keepers in De Gea  and Courtois but the future looks bright with Oblak .","Atletico Madrid 0-0 Real Madrid: Click here for Martin Samuel's report .

Stancil, who gave himself fascist face tattoos, is awaiting extradition from Florida to North Carolina, where he is accused of fatally shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane. Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, told Raleigh's WRAL-TV on Wednesday that he killed Lane earlier this week in North Carolina because Lane had made sexual advances to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Scroll down for video . Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, claimed in a prison interview on Wednesday that he had killed a gay college supervisor because he made sexual advances towards his teenage brother . In a telephone interview from a Daytona Beach jail, Stancil said Lane tried to take advantage of his brother. 'He ain't physically touched him, but he was in the proposal to try to and I wasn't going to let that happen,' Stancil said. Stancil said Lane was looking for Stancil on Facebook and found his brother. A Goldsboro police spokesman did not immediately return a phone message on Thursday about that allegation. 'I'd do anything necessary to take care of my family,' Stancil said. He said he has no regrets about the shooting. 'I did what I did, and I've got to live with it. If I get life, I just get life. 'I'm a murderer, you know, what the hell do I got to care? 'I don't give a damn if I go back to society.' Stancil, shot dead his former work-study supervisor Ron Lane (pictured) and claimed to have killed three others - although police had no reports of unsolved homicides . Stancil said he is a neo-Nazi who is concerned about the future of white children. 'I try to look out for my fellow white people,' he said. 'I don't believe in race mixing.' He was asked if he hates gays. 'Yes, I do, with a passion,' he replied, though he said that was only one of the reasons he killed Lane, who had been his supervisor in a work study program at the college before he was fired for absenteeism. Stancil also told the television station he had killed three other people, including two in the Wayne County area. But the sheriff's department told the station it has no report of any unsolved homicides that match Stancil's account. The accused killer appeared in court in Florida on Tuesday where he admitted to the killing, WRAL reported, despite the judge advising him he could remain silent. He confessed to the shooting in an obscenity-laced statement, saying he 'ridded one last child molester from the Earth'. He said Lane, who had been his supervisor at the college's print shop until Stancil was fired last month, had been 'messing with' one of Stancil's family members. Lane was gay, and authorities said they are investigating a possible hate crime. They haven't released a motive for the shooting, but Stancil was dismissed from a work study program at the print shop last month. His mother, Debbie Stancil, said her son was angry over being dismissed from his work-study job for excessive absenteeism. She also said Lane made sexually laced comments to her son. 'He was verbally inappropriate with Morgan at school. Very much verbally inappropriate,' she said. 'He would tell him to stop and he kept on.' The 20-year-old is facing a charge of open murder. Stancil pictured with his mother Debbie at his graduation. She said he is 'rattled and confused and needs mental help'.

It was given as a gift to two sisters who worked as servants for the Nightingale family at Lea Hurst, near Matlock, Derbyshire. Dating back to around 1840, the 10in tall lamp will go under the hammer at Hansons in Etwall, Derbyshire, on June 26. After her experiences in the war Nightingale returned to Derbyshire, where she had spent her childhood, in the 1850s. She wrote of what she had seen in the conflict with her 1859 Notes on Nursing still considered as having shaped the profession today. During the war she became known as The Lady with the Lamp thanks to a report in The Times. She had been sent to Selimiye Barracks in Scutari, now Istanbul, in 1854 to care for soldiers. She pleaded with the British newspaper to appeal to the Government for better working conditions having been horrified by the squalor and disease fighters faced. The result was Renkioi Hospital, a civilian facility built in England and shipped to the area to care for those who had been hurt. It was there Nightingale earned her nickname, carrying a lamp as she completed rounds of the hospital's patients through the night. The lamp from her Derbyshire home was passed down through generations of the Lea Hurst servants' family. Auctineer Charles Hanson said: ‘The lamp is quite remarkable. It has a wonderful provenance, which confirms it helped ignite Florence and her writings late into many a Derbyshire night. 'Such an iconic object and it’s association with such a leading lady will be guided at £1000-2000. With interest and competition it may just ignite, since it is such a wonderful object.'

462,d11ecbcc828403caa6d356def04c77b373de4459,"The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has denied that partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities. Countering President Barack Obama's previous assertion, Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal'. The 62-year-old politician continued: 'We just set in place a process to ensure that if there's a deal, it's a deal that will stand the test of time, that will keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.' Making an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Corker  said that Congressional scrutiny and approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran is essential to help make sure that the deal is not a bad one. Scroll down for video . Chairman: Senator Bob Corker (pictured), of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has denied partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities . He said that Congress has a responsibility to scour the details of a final plan - including any classified annexes - and ask the Obama administration hard questions about it, before finally voting on it. 'It's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions,' Corker said. Negotiators announced a framework deal on Thursday. The deal is scheduled to be finalized by June 30. Meanwhile, the Committee is due to meet April 14 to consider Corker's legislation to ensure that Congress debates and signs off on any pact. The bill requires the president to transmit, within five days of reaching a final deal, the text of the full agreement, along with materials related to its implementation. With key elements still to be finalized, the framework agreement sealed by U.S.-led world powers describes a program for stunting Iran's capacity to produce nuclear weapons, while giving Tehran quick access to assets and markets now blocked by international sanctions. In defending the framework and a potential final pact, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities. Argument: Countering President Barack Obama's (pictured) previous assertion, Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, told Fox News Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal' These will allow the U.S. and its partner negotiators to know almost instantly should Iran try to evade the oversight, Moniz said during an appearance on CBS' 'Face The Nation. This is a long-term arrangement, he stressed, with requirements lasting a quarter century or more. 'We'll have eyes on the entire supply chain of uranium,' he added on the program. 'Going back to mines, the mills, we'll have continuous surveillance of centrifuge production.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the framework as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. He is urging negotiators to improve the agreement or scuttle it. Other Republicans have echoed Netanyahu's concerns. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Sunday the proposed deal is a bad one - but was the best one Obama could get because the Iranians don't fear or respect him. Response: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) has criticized the framework deal as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. But in defending the framework, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (right) cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities . He said that he favors waiting until a new president, Democratic or Republican, takes office in January 2017 and then trying again. In the meantime, economic and financial sanctions would stay in place. 'Is there a better deal to be had? I think so,' Graham said on CBS' 'Face The Nation.' But a senior Senate Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, warned that bashing the proposed deal could backfire on Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister and other critics of the framework agreement have offered no viable alternatives, she said on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Feinstein said imposing more and stiffer economic sanctions would only drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground and make it more difficult to monitor. 'I wish he would contain himself,' Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said of Netanyahu. Officials (L-r) European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, and an unidentified Russian official, look on as British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond shakes hands with Secretary of State John Kerry in Switzerland . The preliminary deal,  announced in Switzerland on Thursday, sees Iran agree to not build any new centrifuges for 15 years, and not enrich uranium at the previously secret Fordow site for 15 years. The country also agrees to reduce nuclear-material centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, let the IAEA store all the extra centrifuges, give IAEA inspectors access to its uranium mills for 25 years and rebuild heavy-water reactor at Arak so it can't produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it would not build any new heavy-water reactors for 15 years. In return, the West will give Iran relief from nuclear-related economic sanctions 'if it verifiably abides by its commitments', and lift 'all past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue' as soon as Iran has completed all its promised 'nuclear-related actions'.

Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series.

A deputy of disgraced former mayor Lutfur Rahman yesterday appeared to blame the vote-rigging scandal on ‘institutional racism’. Oliur Rahman, who took over from the deposed leader yesterday, insisted there was deep-rooted racism within the East London borough of Tower Hamlets. His comment was at odds with a devastating legal ruling that condemned his predecessor for bribery and ballot fraud and found he had repeatedly ‘played the race card’ to silence critics. The two men – who are not related – are both members of the Tower Hamlets First party. Political opponents said they were playing the same ‘cracked record’ by seeking to blame racism and Islamophobia for their problems. Oliur Rahman told the BBC: ‘If people say there is no racism in Tower Hamlets, then they are very much mistaken because there is institutional racism. ‘If people want to turn a blind eye to the racism then that’s their decision but they are very much mistaken if they turn round and say there is no racism in Tower Hamlets, and that people are not judged because of their skin colour and their religion.’ On Thursday, electoral judge Richard Mawrey QC found that Lutfur Rahman, 49, and his cronies had rigged the 2014 mayoral ballot by creating an army of ‘ghost voters’, forging postal votes, bribing Muslim voters and using religious intimidation against them and branding opponents as racists. He found that all the councillors from the Tower Hamlets First party were elected corruptly. Oliur Rahman, 34, a former councillor for George Galloway’s Respect party but now a Tower Hamlets First councillor, emailed his fellow members yesterday to declare himself acting mayor until new elections. He said: ‘Following the verdict, I have assumed the executive role within the council, until a mayoral election is held.’ Peter Golds, the leader of the Tory group in Tower Hamlets, said: ‘Oliur Rahman ought to be hanging his head in shame and apologising to the borough, but I don’t think he gets it. ‘It’s ludicrous to play the race card again. They roll out this hoary old chestnut every time anything happens. The real unpleasant racism has come from the ranks of Tower Hamlets First. ‘They’ve got one cracked record, that any criticism of them is Islamophobic and racist. Now they’re playing it again, despite the court case. Nothing has changed.’ Lutfur Rahman, who was Britain’s first elected Muslim mayor, has met lawyers to discuss seeking a judicial review of the Election Court’s decision that he was responsible for bribery and voter fraud. Supporters said he continued to deny any wrongdoing. Police have been urged to launch a fresh investigation into fraud in the 2014 mayoral election, which will be re-run in June. Lutfur Rahman, a Bangladesh-born former Labour council leader, has been banned from running for public office, or even voting, for five years. Four voters launched legal action against him after complaints that police and the Electoral Commission had failed to act. Andy Erlam - who launched legal action against the mayor with Angela Moffat and Azmal Hussein (pictured left to right) - said Oliur Rahman was in 'complete denial' The group was headed by Andy Erlam, who stood as a councillor on an anti-corruption ticket. Mr Erlam said Lutfur Rahman’s supporters – including Oliur Rahman – were in ‘complete denial’. He added: ‘They are still claiming Rahman didn’t do anything wrong despite a devastating judgment by a respected High Court judge who spent six weeks considering the dreadful evidence. ‘It makes me shudder to think they were in charge of a £1.3billion budget of taxpayers’ money.’","Oliur Rahman took over from deposed mayor Lutfur Rahman yesterday .

465,fc1813a2c4ac4a320c1874e5974a09cea9c9a381,"(CNN)Most kids want to go out and play when they finish their homework early. But Zuriel Oduwole isn't ""most kids."" When she gets ahead of her work, she packs her camera and microphones, jumps on a plane and interviews presidents instead. Born in California to a Nigerian father and a Mauritian mother, Oduwole is often described as ""the world's youngest filmmaker."" Aged 12, she already has four documentaries under her belt -- all of which focus on African issues. It all started three years ago when Oduwole decided to enter a school documentary-making competition with a film about the Ghana revolution. Jerry John Rawlings (Ghana) John Kufour (Ghana) Joyce Banda (Malawi) Jakaya Kikwete (Tanzania) Rajkeswur Purryag (Mauritius) Uhuru Kenyatta (Kenya) Goodluck Johnathan (Nigeria) Salva Kirr Mayardit (South Sudan) Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (Liberia) Jorge Fonseco (Cape Verde) Portia Simpson Miller (Jamaica) Thomas Thabane (Lesotho) Ralph Gonsalves (St Vincent & Grenadines) Denzil Douglas (St Kitts & Nevis) After this first foray into filmmaking, Oduwole was bitten by the director's bug and quickly wanted to make more movies. She turned to the web to find the tools she needed and got involved in the entire filmmaking process. ""As I edit, produce, set up and write the scripts for my documentaries, I have to learn a lot of things,"" says Oduwole, who is self-taught and uses online editing and voice software. Her second outing, ""Educating and Healing Africa Out of Poverty,"" looked at the creation of the African Union in 1963. She followed it up in 2014 with her movie ""Technology in Educational Development."" But it was her most recent project that catapulted her to international recognition. Released late last year, ""A Promising Africa"" (watch trailer below) is the first in an ongoing series which will profile five African nations, starting with her father's homeland of Nigeria. ""I've interviewed 14 heads of state and a few of those include the President of Tanzania, Liberia, Kenya, South Sudan, Nigeria and Cape Verde, to name a few,"" says Oduwole. ""I've also been able to interview business leaders like my friend Mr Aliko Dangote."" To date, ""A Promising Africa"" has received a limited-release on the big screen in five countries -- Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, UK and Japan. The young trailblazer, who was named by Business Insider as one of world's 100 most powerful individuals last year, delightedly recalls seeing her film on the big screen and walking the red carpet in Lagos. ""I'm hoping that when people see these documentaries they will see Africa is full of positive things -- not just the things that are on the news like war, famine, disease,"" she says. ""I want to show them there is a lot more to Africa than what we see on the news -- there's dancing, music, great culture and more."" Although she's just 12, Oduwole, who is home-schooled through an online Californian system, is already a 9th grader -- two years ahead of the rest of the kids her age. Her mother, Patricia, has a full-time job as a computer engineer, whilst her father, Ademola, has taken time off his work in the tourism sector to help organize a lot of what Zuriel and her three other siblings are doing. ""There really is a lot happening in our household but somehow we make it work,"" says Patricia Oduwole. In addition to her documentary work, Oduwole has also become something of an education advocate. She travels to different African countries and the diaspora on a regular basis to talk to students about the importance of education. So far, through her side project ""Dream Up, Speak Up, Stand Up"" she says she's had the opportunity to talk to 21,000 children in nine countries. ""Girl's education is important because on the African continent, where there are not as many resources, the boys are the first [to get an education],"" says Oduwole. ""The boys go to school and get an education while the girls stay at home. And those girls aren't educated and have fewer options in life when they get older.""

His apology came nearly four years after bedding her for the last time. Ryan, 41, phoned Rhodri, 38, and the two brothers are now reconciling in an attempt to rebuild their relationship. Celebrity Big Brother star: Natasha Giggs had an eight-year affair with football legend Ryan Giggs . Reconciliation: Rhodri (left) and brother Ryan (right) have ended their four-year feud over the affair . A source told the Sun newspaper that 'Ryan rang Rhodri out of the blue a few weeks ago. Rhodri moved on a long time ago but was adamant Ryan had to make the first move as he was the one who had done wrong.' On Easter Sunday the two brothers were spotted out together with friends at the Neighbourhood bar in Manchester. A clubber said: 'They were sitting in the VIP area and looked like they were enjoying each other's company again.' Happy families: Ryan with wife Stacey Cooke on the red carpet in 2011 before the affair revelations . High Court injunction battle: Ryan Giggs spent £150,000 trying to silence Big Brother star Imogen Thomas from revealing details of their affair . Rhodri with his wife Natasha before he knew about her eight-year affair with his brother Ryan . The affair was first revealed in June 2011 when Rhodri's wife Natasha admitted an eight-year affair with the former star winger. Natasha also said she had aborted Ryan's baby just weeks before she got married to Rhodri in Las Vegas. She decided to go public in 2011 after Ryan Giggs' controversial attempt to place a gagging order on Big Brother star Imogen Thomas after their six-month affair ended. Ryan Giggs' attempt at silencing Imogen Thomas backfired when a Twitter campaign resulted in an MP naming him in parliament . He spent £150,000 getting a High Court injunction against her. However, his attempt to silence her fell apart after a sustained Twitter campaign that resulted in an MP naming him in parliament. In January 2012, Natasha went on to Celebrity Big Brother, where she openly talked about the affair to her fellow housemates. Ryan lives with wife Stacey and their two children in a £4m mansion. He is currently part of Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal’s backroom staff with his side third in the Barclays Premier League. Natasha originally left Rhodri but the two later unsuccessfully tried to reconcile, and they divorced in 2013. Natasha, 32, had a son last year with a new partner. Rhodri is now married to Ashleigh Turner, 24, and they have a baby son. Much happier times: Ryan (left) with his  brother Rhodri (right) as young children before their fallout .

Carl Hendrick, head of learning and research at Wellington College, Berkshire, has attacked the ‘tidal wave of guff’ in classrooms. These ‘missives in mediocrity’ often tell pupils to ‘live your dream’ and ‘you can do it’ and ‘be all that you can be’. Cheesy slogans such as ‘reach for the stars’ on posters in schools could be detrimental to pupils, it has been claimed. Above, a stock image of a motivational poster . But the glossy notices are ‘often reductively misinterpreted as “you can achieve anything if you believe”’. Mr Hendrick argues that schools should concentrate on boosting pupils’ confidence by teaching them well and providing ‘clear and achievable paths to academic success’. Writing in a blog, he claimed that motivational posters ‘sit alongside a set of approaches that may well be doing more harm than good’. But Vic Goddard, headmaster of Passmores Academy in Harlow, Essex, and star of Educating Essex, told the Times Educational Supplement he is a fan of the posters.

They should also avoid discussing ‘unflattering photos of celebrities’, how ageing ravages people’s looks and ‘fat-shaming’ youngsters. The advice is supposed to help pupils develop positive body images amid ‘society’s intense focus on physical appearance’.","Cheesy slogans could be detrimental to pupils, a researcher claimed .

This is also prime territory for a gallery­ lover like me: the beautiful, elegant and not-­too-­big Mauritshuis was restored last year. This is also the home of Girl With A Pearl Earring, the 'Dutch Mona Lisa'. But I am not only here for the Vermeer, Rembrandt and Hals. Much more than a village: The Parliament Building stands proud in The Hague - a hidden gem of a city . There is the Escher gallery (devoted to that geometry-­defying genius), the contemporary art Gemeentemuseum and more. Meanwhile, I am being charmed by an unsuspected delight: this medieval city by the sea. 'City? This is Europe's biggest village,' says my guide, Remco Dörr. He is right: The Hague, despite being home to Holland's royal family and an eye-­catching parliament, was classed as a village until Louis Bonaparte (Napoleon's brother and king of Holland) set up here in 1806. It has a genteel moat/canal, which encircles the historic centre. We step across and in front of an approaching car, which slows down deferentially. Remco tells me that many traffic lights have been taken out for aesthetic reasons. 'Now, the cars are very careful,' he says. The Hague is home to one of the cornerstones of European art - Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring . You have to love that kind of Dutch logic - though it doesn't seem to apply to cyclists, who rule the place. Next time, I will rent a bicycle, although the trams and buses are easy and cheap (an all-day pass costs €7.70/£5.60). Over the moat, we are in Noordeinde street. Remco ushers me into what used to be part of a palace, and still has huge chandeliers and ornate mirrors. This cobbled part of town is home to private galleries and unassuming cafes (I snacked in the Juni Lekkernijen), as well as altogether more assuming ones. HanTing is the latest Michelin star in town and the best place for Indonesian cuisine. The most prized Dutch colony was apparently run from The Hague (aka 'the Widow of Indonesia'). For summer: the excellent Grapes & Olives and the Café de Bieb on Veenkade will have boats on a newly renovated bit of canal, with music and boat trips planned, including a tour at the Kompaan brewery (I can vouch for the product). My art gorging finishes at the Panorama, an extraordinary, 14 ft-­high circular panorama of The Hague's seaside resort, Scheveningen, painted by Hendrik Mesdag. I take a 15-minute tram to the place itself and gorge on scallops and sole at Catch by Simonis on the harbour front. The Hague has netted a new fan.

Officials have complained the bronze sculpture of Yu The Great's wife has been worn down and discolored by sightseers constantly fondling the artwork, reports The People's Daily. The statue, which stands in a gardens in Wuhan, the capital city of central China’s Hubei Province, is to honour Yu The Great, who founded China's first dynasty in 2070 BC. Officials in Wuhan, the capital city of central China’s Hubei Province, have accused tourists of damaging a statue of the country's first leader and his wife by fondling the woman's exposed breast . The sculpture, which has been in place for ten years, depicts Yu The Great, the founder of China's first Xia Dynasty in 2070 BC, meeting his wife . Legend says that Yu and his wife were brought together by a nine-tailed fox that lead them to one another . The bronze tells the story of how the leader met his wife, after the couple were supposedly brought together by a mythical nine-tailed fox. Over the decade that the statue has been in place, people have been touching the hand of Yu The Great, the fox's back, and wife's chest. While the rest of the statue is black, the colour of the coating applied to protect the metal, the parts that have been touched have worn away to expose the metal underneath. Over the years tourists have kept touching Yu's hand, the fox's back, and his wife's exposed breast - leading to them becoming worn . While the rest of the metallic sculpture is black, the colour of the protective layer which coats the statue, the fox, hand and breast have become worn, exposing the metal underneath . Locals accuse tourists of having a lack of respect for culture, but admit the behaviour is unlikey to change . Yu the Great is thought to have lived between 2,200–2,100 BCE, and is credited with uniting the nine early provinces of China. While little is known about his rule, as his predates the earliest written records by nearly a millennium, he is credited with building an immense system of flood defences in central China. These helped to bring prosperity and stability to the volatile region, and so impressed another emperor that he named Yu as his heir, rather than his own son.","Statue in Wuhan, central China, depicts country's first ruler and his wife .

Channel Seven's Sunday Night will tell the story of Ivan Milat's first violent crime and how he escaped police prosecution, before going on to butcher seven backpackers. The revelation includes first-hand evidence from Milat's older brother, Boris, into the killer's 'secret victim'. Scroll down for video . A new report claims Ivan Milat, Australia's most notorious serial killer, could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers . Boris Milat shares a secret he has kept for 52 years, which details how Australia's bloodiest butcher was responsible for the shooting more than two decades before the first backpacker murder in 1989, according to the report. The program also puts Mr Milat face-to-face with the 'wrong man', who was jailed for the first crime his brother committed. 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man, who Channel Seven has not yet named, tells Mr Milat, as they shake hands. According to the timeline presented by the program and Mr Milat, his murderous brother would have been a 19-year-old when he claimed his first victim. Former Detective Paul Gordon tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible'. Boris Milat tells the program a secret about his brother he had kept for more than 52 years . Milat was later sentenced to life in prison, but if the 'wrong man' (right) had not been jailed for his first crime, Milat's victims could have been saved, the program claims . 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man imprisoned for Milat's first violent crime told the killer's brother, Boris . Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. The first two bodies of Milat’s victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest. According to claims made by the program, Milat would have been about 19 when he claimed his first victim . The daughter of Milat's first victim (left) is told her father was shot by the serial killer. Former Detective Paul Gordon (right) tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible' The report claims Milat's seven victims could have been saved if he had been been held accountable for this first chilling crime . Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head. The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl’s stabbed body in November of the same year. The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart. British backpacker Caroline Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head when police found her body . First victims: Australians James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both aged 19, were Ivan Milat's first known victims after they disappeared in December 1989 and their bodies were found in the Belanglo State forest almost four years later . Simone Schmidl's body was found in November 1993. She had been stabbed to death . Milat was convicted of the seven backpacker murders on July 27, 1996 and for the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Paul Onions. He kept the shirts, sleeping bags, a water bottle, portable stove and backpacks of his victims hidden in roof and wall cavities, in what was described as an 'Aladdin's Cave', in the house he was arrested in 20 years ago. Boyfriend and girlfriend German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied were found dead on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart . British backpacker Joanne Walters, is another one of the victims of backpacker murderer Ivan Milat . Sinister souvenir: In this photograph police seized from the house of Ivan Milat's brother William, the serial killer is seen carrying the sleeping bag which belonged to Deborah Everist who with boyfriend Jame Gibson was the first of Milat's victims killed in the Belanglo State Forest . The evil killer has penned a series of rambling letters while behind bars, according to a book released by his eldest nephew, Alistair Shipsey. The Milat Letters, is a compilation of 94 notes from Milat to his eldest nephew Alistair Shipsey. Milat is serving seven consecutive life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers in  NSW between 1989 and 1992. In the letters, he tells Shipsey about his 'fair share' of 'sheilas', who write 'some frightening things' - and one woman who has even proposed. Australia's worst serial killer Ivan Milat kept trophies to remind him of each murder . Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992 in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW . 'Every month someone new writes; the latest one was from Texas. She tells me she’s 25, white. I ought to ask her “why” as she only knows me from a website, and there’s nothing nice about me on it,' one of the letters reads. 'As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well. A lot of them write to me at times. I tell you Al, there are some real crazy people out and about.' Milat has been a troublesome inmate during his time in prison, and it is believed he planned at least one escape and swallowed metal objects in an attempt to get out of jail. An extract from one of the letters from Milat, written before he chopped his own finger off with a plastic knife in January 2009, affectionately refers to Shipsey as 'Al . In prison, Milat, has been a troublesome inmate, having planned at least one escape, swallowing metal objects and cutting off his own finger to send to the High Court in an envelope . One of his letters revealed plans to cut off his own finger and mail it law enforcement. ‘I will send them parts of my hand first, I have been considering this for a while and only need half a reason to show them how I feel with their sh**head ideas, there is not much they can do to me any more and at my age I don't give a f**k,' an excerpt from his letters reads.

Karlis Bardelis, 30, from Latvia, was attempting to scale the cliff in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, when the accident happened. And footage from a camera mounted to his helmet shows the very second that his climbing axe came loose. Mr Berdalis said: 'I was just thinking ""I hope I land somewhere soft and don't break any bones"".' Scroll down for video . The footage shows climber Karlis Bardelis carefully traversing the ridge, left, but one wrong move sends him tumbling down the icy cliff face in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, right .

Bardelis has only just released the footage of his terrifying fall on a training exercise in hospital . Between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds in the video below, you can see the axe slipping out of the ice and knocking his other axe out of position. Almost immediately his feet were in the air and Karlis can see nothing but his boots and the blue sky as he begins the terrifying fall down the 60m mountain. He continues to fall for three-and-a-half seconds until he's eventually saved by his safety rope after falling ten metres. But the experienced Latvian climber, who now works in Nepal, held his nerve after the tumble and even continued his ascent to the top. Bardelis scaling the mountain which he fell from. On the left you can see the safety rope that saved his life . Holding his nerve: The experienced climber grips the rock face on his ascent . He said: 'My ropes saved me and stopped my fall. 'These kind of falls are very dangerous because I'm carrying two ice tools and crampons, both of which are really sharp and could cause serious injuries. 'Obviously there's the risk of hitting a rock on my way down, which can cause serious fractures. 'I never think that I'm going to die in these situations - I never consider death as an option' Karlis had travelled to Scotland to take part in a training course organised by the British Mountaineering Council joining climbers from 26 countries. And he attempted the level six climb with some trepidation. Life on the line: Bardelis was rescued by his safety rope after his axe became dislodged from the ice, knocking the other out of position and sending him plunging down the mountain . He said: 'I was feeling excited about that climb but at the same time I was feeling scared in those difficult parts too. 'I fell because I made a mistake; I put one ice axe in a crack and was trying to put another one in but the placement wasn't good so it ripped the other one out. 'My crampons weren't in a stable place so I fell.' The footage shows Karlis tumble backwards from the cliff face and free fall towards the ground. Incredibly, after being saved by his harness, Karlis continued his ascent after the fall. He said: 'I climbed back to the same place and this time did it right using the same technique. 'Some people laugh when they see the video - others say they are not going to sleep after seeing it. 'I guess it was a good example of how not to climb.'

The 250-piece Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the #LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party .","The designer diffusion line went on sale Sunday morning but was almost completely sold out online before noon, with stores selling out minutes after opening .

478,2b6ac8c0fdc51a434e659ded956df5153466bdad,"Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has ordered an official probe into claims that a civil servant leaked an official account of a private meeting between Nicola Sturgeon and the French ambassador. The SNP leader has denied telling French ambassador Sylvie Bermann that she would prefer David Cameron to remain in Number 10 while suggesting that Ed Miliband was not Prime Minister material. Ms Sturgeon told supporters at a rally in Glasgow today that she had written to Sir Jeremy to demand an official investigation. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon, pictured, had asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to investigate the leaked memo . She told supporters in Glasgow today that the Westminster establishment were afraid of the SNP's rise and called on Ed Miliband to commit to 'locking out' David Cameron from Downing Street next month . Ms Sturgeon completely denied claims that she secretly hoped David Cameron would win the election . She claimed that the story was a sign of 'panic' within the Westminster establishment over the surge of support for her party. She then called on Mr Miliband to publicly commit to working with the SNP to 'lock out' Mr Cameron from Downing Street in the event of a hung parliament. Ms Sturgeon described the account of her conversation with the French ambassador as '100 per cent untrue'. The memo was published in the Daily Telegraph was written by a British civil servant following a conversation with consul-general Pierre-Alain Coffinier regarding the meeting between Ms Sturgeon and ambassador Sylvie Bermann, who was on her first visit to Scotland in February. According to the memo: 'Discussion appears to have focused mainly on the political situation, with the FM stating that she wouldn't want a formal coalition with Labour; that the SNP would almost certainly have a large number of seats ... that she'd rather see David Cameron remain as PM.' The note went on to say that Ms Sturgeon had said she did not think Labour leader Ed Miliband was 'prime minister material'. The civil servant added: 'I have to admit that I'm not sure that the FM's tongue would be quite so loose on that kind of thing in a meeting like that, so it might well be a case of something being lost in translation'. Mr Coffinier - who was at the meeting - told Sky News that he had no recollection of Ms Sturgeon's alleged comments. He said: 'I do not know where this comes from, because it is certainly not in my report that anyone gave any preference.' David Cameron, pictured today, said any deal between Labour and the SNP would be a 'chaos alliance' A spokesman for the Ms Bermann said: 'While the Ambassador and First Minister, some time ago, discussed the political situation, Ms Sturgeon did not touch on her personal political preferences with regards to the future prime minister.' Attending an anti-nuclear rally in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said: ""This story has already been shown to be 100 per cent untrue - having been comprehensively rejected by both the French Ambassador and Consul General. 'The real issue is how a second-hand and inaccurate account of this meeting - which was not even attended by the UK Government - came to be written by a UK Government civil servant and then leaked to Tory-supporting newspapers at the start of a General Election campaign. 'It suggests a Whitehall system out of control - a place where political dirty tricks are manufactured and leaked. And the Foreign Office now appears to be denying the very existence of such a document. Nicola Sturgeon would rather see David Cameron win the election because she does not see Ed Miliband as ‘prime minister material’, it was reported last night. A memo shows that the Scottish first minister told the French ambassador in February she would prefer to see Mr Cameron remain in Downing Street. The document, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, undermines the SNP leader’s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with Labour to keep the Conservatives out of office. The SNP’s opponents say the party would favour another Tory-led Westminster government, against which it could campaign in an attempt to stoke up anti-English sentiment and make an ‘out’ vote more likely in another referendum. Written by a senior civil servant, the memo from February 26 states: ‘The first minister confessed that she’d rather see David Cameron remain as PM (and didn’t see Ed Miliband as PM material).’ She has denied the claims while last night Last night the French consul general told the Guardian that no such views were given by Miss Sturgeon, and 'absolutely no preference was expressed' on the outcome of the general election. 'I am therefore writing to the head of the UK civil service, Sir Jeremy Heywood, requesting an urgent inquiry into the circumstances of such a false account being leaked for transparently political motives.' The SNP leader added: 'Anyone who knows anything about me knows I don't want to see a Conservative government. I'm campaigning to get the Tories out of Downing Street. We've made if very clear that we will lock David Cameron out of Downing Street - the only person who's not made that clear is Ed Miliband. 'We've said that if there are more SNP and Labour MPs than there are Tory MPs, then we will vote to stop a Tory government even getting off the ground. I reissue my challenge to Ed Miliband today to say likewise.' Conservative Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'Who knows what the reality is there? I think the one thing that we do know is that the SNP seem to be doing very well in Scotland at the moment ... and it strongly suggests that the only way Ed Miliband could every come into office is in coalition with the SNP and that would mean chaos for Britain.' And a Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband still won't rule out a deal with the SNP because he knows he can't get into Number 10 without them - he's in the pocket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon has him on a leash. 'And we know what's in the ransom note: £148 billion more wasteful borrowing, higher taxes on ordinary families, weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: 'The First Minister might deny reports of her tete-a-tete with the French but we all know a Conservative-only government is the result of this election that the SNP want to see. A Tory PM governing alone in Downing Street and veering to the right fuels nationalist fires back home. 'Despite her fluffy, positive words about working with the rest of the UK we know what she really thinks. Her sole ambition is to break up the UK.' Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured, has announced a full investigation into the growing scandal . Ed Miliband, pictured, said he will not enter into any coalition with the SNP as he wants a majority . Mr Miliband described the leaked memo as a 'damning revelation' claiming the SNP were saying one thing in private and something completely different in public. He said: 'I'm very clear that there won't be a coalition with the SNP. That's not going to happen, As for how other parties will end up voting on a Labour Queen's Speech, that's a matter for them. I want a majority Labour government.' Mr Miliband refused to rule out any post-election deal where he would rely on SNP support to prop up a minority government. He added: 'What I'm saying very clearly is we are not going to have a coalition with the SNP. As for other post-election possibilities, I'm not getting into that.' Prime Minister David Cameron joined the row while campaigning in Oxfordshire today. He said: 'There is this coalition of chaos alliance we could end up with if we are not careful - an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt Britain - Labour - and the people who want to break up Britain - the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond. 'That's what we have got to avoid, that big danger of a coalition of chaos that would take our country back.' He claimed Ms Sturgeon's disputed opinion of the Labour leader 'told us something that I said about four years ago - that Ed Miliband is not up to the job of being prime minister. I think we knew that already'.","SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon dismissed claims she wants a Tory victory .

The other, five decades on, pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair. These exclusive pictures obtained by Daily Mail Online show dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Dr Fredric Brandt, the year he graduated from Frank H Morrell High, Irvington, New Jersey. They were taken at the age of 18, when he was, in his own words, just ‘a Jewish kid from Newark,’ and before he had transformed himself, in every sense, into the figure lampooned on Netflix show ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,’ with such devastating consequences. Scroll down for video . The way he was: These exclusive pictures obtained by Daily Mail Online show dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Dr Frederic Brandt, the year he graduated from Frank H Morrell High in New Jersey . Dispirited: The famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. He had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show . Changes: Five decades after his high school photo with his shy smile, steady gaze and dark hair, Dr. Brandt was pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair . It is two days since the famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. The City of Miami Police confirmed the suicide after Daily Mail Online broke the news earlier, and, according to those closest to Brandt, the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show. Now, seen here for the first time, Dr Brandt’s High School photos provide a glimpse into his life before fame, fortune and fillers. The pictures, taken in 1967, show a hint of the smile that, according to the school’s yearbook earned him a reputation for his ‘infectious grin’ and saw him characterized by his sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.’ Born Frederic Sheldon Brandt in 1949, he was prolific in his High School achievements, posing in one photo alongside other award-winning students. Among his many accolades listed are Assistant Editor of High School magazine the Morellian, President of the Spanish Club, Vice President of the Debate Club, Vice President of the Political Science Club and a place on the National Honors Society. He was also an enthusiastic member of the Theatre Arts Society and Tennis team. He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student. But, for all that, in one of his last interviews, given to the New York Times in March 2014, he recalled feeling very much that he was ‘more of a different child,’ as he grew up in the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey. He said: ‘I remember taking things apart as a kid, radios and other things. I was always questioning everything to see how it worked.’ In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth – he had hundreds of patients, saw as many as 30 daily with some paying as much as $7,000 a pop and had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store. Three years before he graduated and before these pictures were taken, when he was just 15 years old, Brandt’s father died from complications of juvenile diabetes. Seven years later, as he was entering his first year at medical school, his mother died unexpectedly. Loss: Three years before these pictures were taken, when he was just 15 years old, Brandt’s father died from complications of juvenile diabetes. Seven years later, as he was entering his first year at medical school, his mother died unexpectedly . Dr. Brandt was known for his ‘infectious grin’ and characterized by classmates as having a sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.' He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student . The awards and accolades followed him from this 1967 yearbook through his professional career . Speaking to the New York Times last March he admitted: ‘It was a lot to process, but you just have to forge ahead.’ He certainly did. Immediately after high school he attended Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He went on to graduate with his MD from Drexel University’s Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia in 1975. Dermatology was not his first love though it would be the speciality on which he settled and which earned him a client list including Madonna, Kelly Ripa, Stephanie Seymour and a constellation of other entertainment big hitters. As a student he loved oncology, nephrology, hematology and cardiology. The one area of medicine in which the life-long bachelor took no real pleasure was pediatrics. He explained: ‘You spent all your time calming patients down.’ Between 1976 and 1978 he completed his internship at New York University Veterans Administration before going onto specialise in dermatology at the University of Miami, 1978–1981. He set up a private practice in Miami and it was only in 1998 that an invitation to use a colleague’s New York office once a month to treat patients with ever evolving newly introduced facial fillers led Dr Brandt to his ultimate area of expertise.

Hurtful parody: According to those closest to Brandt, the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show . Tina Fey takes a selfie with Maya Rudolph and  Martin Short last February. Poignantly, given his own unhappy demise, Dr Brandt’s ambition in his work had always been, he said, ‘to restore a face to harmony,’ and ‘to keep people working and feeling vital and good about themselves.’ He built an empire on his work. As well as seeing his private patients, he hosted a weekly call-in show on Sirius XM radio, ran a company manufacturing his own line of skin creams and serums and appeared regularly on the speaking circuit proselytizing on his speciality at international medical conferences. Over the years Dr Brandt practiced what he preached. He became best known for his Y lifts in which fillers are injected below the cheekbones. And he regularly injected himself with Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvedem and Voluma leading to his own startlingly changed appearance - converted into cruel and undeniable parody on ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt’ as Dr Franff. The good life: In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth. He had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store . Played by Martin Short Franff’s transformation is so grotesque that he can barely utter certain words – including his own name. He is actually called Grant, rendering the veil of fiction between the character and Brandt even more gossamer thin. At one point the character is seen drinking from a surgical bag and reinflating his face after being punched. For Dr Brandt, who had always prided himself on being ‘a kind of pioneer in pushing the limits to see how things work and what the look would be,’ the humor, viewed through the prism of his depression, cut deep. There have been many tributes since his death Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, yesterday tweeted, ‘Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.’ Morning show host, Kelly Ripa, posted: ‘My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr Frederic Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer.’","Photos obtained by Daily Mail Online show surgeon to the stars Dr Brandt, who hanged himself in Miami on Sunday, the year he graduated from his New Jersey high school .

The 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'.

Redknapp was speaking at the announcement of a Men United XI vs Leyton Orient Legends charity match . The well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances. 'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me. 'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do. Redknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February . Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago . The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time . 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches. He said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level. Redknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club . The Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining . 'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.' Redknapp lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer and is backing the Men United campaign to help raise awareness of the disease, which is the most common cancer in men with more than 10,000 deaths each year. He said: 'Prostate Cancer is something which can affect any family at any time so it is important that people come out to support this cause.

481,e1881f7f324f525e515eb483f5dc5b2da36fe47f,"German air traffic control officials today called for technology that ground staff could use in an emergency to take remote command of a plane. Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of the Deutsche Flugsicherung authority, urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the Germanwings crash last month. Investigators believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane into a French mountainside on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. Disaster: Rescue workers and debris from the Germanwings jet at the crash site near Seyne-les-Alpes, France . Call: Klaus-Dieter Scheurle (above), head of the Deutsche Flugsicherung authority, urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the Germanwings crash last month . Mr Scheurle said in Frankfurt: ‘Such an event might cause us to reconsider systems which would allow the control of aircraft to be taken over by personnel on the ground in emergency situations.’ He added that it was important to ‘think past today's technology’, explaining that such a system could be used in an emergency on the ground to take remote control of a plane and safely land it. Mr Scheurle said that it was not the ‘simplest solution’, adding that similar technology is already available for piloting drones - but it could take a decade to develop it for passenger jets. Pilots associations are sceptical of the plans, with German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit saying the idea of remote control from the ground could be open to abuse. In charge: Investigators believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately flew the plane into a French mountainside on March 24, killing all 150 people on board . Tribute: Flowers in front of the monument in homage to the victims of the Germanwings flight in Le Vernet . A spokesman said: ‘We also have to ask whether such a solution would really be an improvement. After all, it's the pilots who are sitting in the cockpit and they're the ones with all the information.’ The British Airline Pilots' Association also urged caution. ‘We must act with careful consideration to ensure new safety risks or concerns are not created, such as those raised by the vulnerability of any form of remote control of a passenger aircraft,’ a spokesman said. Since the Germanwings crash, European airlines have implemented a rule that two people must be in the cockpit at all times and Germany has set up a task force with the aviation industry to consider changes to medical and psychological tests for pilots. Commercial planes could be hacked in flight by passengers using the in-flight entertainment system to access flight controls, a US watchdog agency warned last night. Cyber-security experts said onboard firewalls intended to protect aircraft electronics from hackers could be breached if flight control and entertainment systems use the same wiring and routers. A 'virus or malware’ planted on websites visited by passengers could provide an opportunity for a malicious attack, one expert told Government Accountability Office investigators. A GAO report identified the hacking risk as one of several emerging weaknesses that the Federal Aviation Administration must address as air traffic control systems advance in technology. The publication said: ‘Internet connectivity in the cabin should be considered a direct link between the aircraft and the outside world, which includes potential malicious actors.’ FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the aviation regulator has begun working with US government security experts including the National Security Agency to identify needed changes. ‘This threat will continue to evolve and it is something that needs to be at the forefront of our thinking,’ he told a Senate oversight panel. Politicians in Congress called on the FAA to act.","Deutsche Flugsicherung urges aviation industry to develop safety system .

Using statistics from Sleep Cycle app users, researchers have discovered that the earliest wake-up time worldwide is on a Monday in South Africa. While on Tuesdays, Americans rise at 7am and are in the worst mood all week. In terms of national average sleep quality, Slovakia topped the list.  The UK was in 45th place, while the US was in 49th. The best sleep quality worldwide occurs on a Wednesday night. More than half (58 per cent) of countries surveyed said they had the most restful sleep on this day . Other countries that wake-up grumpy on Tuesdays include Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa and Brazil. The Sleep Cycle app tracks a user's sleep as they go through a cycle of sleep phases. It uses the phone's accelerometer to identify phases by tracking movements in bed and wakes users up during their lightest sleep phase, using a pre-defined 30-minute alarm window.

For days now, detectives have swarmed over three bedroom Leeton home where Stephanie Scott's accused killer, high school cleaner Vincent Stanford, 24, lived with his mother Anika and elder brother Luke. In a rare scene of frantic activity on this peaceful suburban street, home to families and pensioners, investigators clad in blue forensic overalls heaped bags of evidence out the back of the property on Thursday evening. Detectives had first arrived at the property on Wednesday night speaking to two occupants before Mr Stanford arrived home and charged after investigators discovered discrepancies in his alibi. Police allege they discovered blood inside the school cleaner's Toyota Hilux, a picture of a burnt body on his mobile phone and a set of school keys thought to belong to Ms Scott inside the property itself. Neighbours told Daily Mail Australia the Stanford family have lived at the property, which is on the market for $179,000, for 'around 13 months'. Gail Scanlan, who lives next-door, said they would regularly chat to the 'beautifully manner' but quiet Mr Stanford over the backyard fence. Scroll down for video .

This week’s remarkable spell of sunshine in southern England is to continue – and warm up. The temperature in the South is forecast to reach 24C (75F) today and 25C (77F) tomorrow, surpassing the highest seen so far this year, the 21.9C (71.4F) recorded in London on Friday. The delightful weather, caused by warm air blowing up from the Azores, is creating conditions we might usually experience in July or August. Scroll down for video . Beach life: People enjoy the weather at Barry Island  in south Wales yesterday, as most of England and Wales enjoys  warm spring conditions .

Unusual sight: A man appears to walk across a rainbow at the beach at Barry Island, near Cardiff in south Wales yesterday . Stunning: A fog bank rolling onto Portsmouth from the Solent, after cool air moved quickly over the surface of the warm water . Britons are so confident of a scorching summer that bookmakers are receiving tens of thousands of pounds in bets on this year breaking records. The record for the hottest day ever in Britain was set more than a decade ago in August 2003 when temperatures hit 38.1C (101F) in Gravesend, Kent. Coral’s price on this summer being the hottest on record has fallen from 10/1 to 2/1, while Ladbrokes has 5/6 on this spring being the warmest ever. There has been a surge in bets after the recent warm weather, and William Hill has 8/1 odds that the temperature will exceed 100F (37.8C) this year. Ladbrokes is also offering 8/1 that the April record of 29.4C (84.9F) set in 1949 in Camden, north London, will be broken by the end of the month. The forecast for today is actually warmer than the 18C (64F) average daytime temperature in August, and way ahead of the 11C (52F) normally expected in April. This weekend will be slightly cooler than the dizzy heights expected tomorrow, but the clear skies and above-average temperatures are forecast to last well into next week. Met Office spokesman Laura Young said last night: ‘We are expecting some really good temperatures over the next few days. Unless you are in north-west Scotland, which will see quite a lot of rain, it will be dry and sunny. ‘On Tuesday we could see 23C to 25C (73F to 77F) in prolonged sunshine. That is double the daytime average for this time of year. ‘Wednesday will be 22C to 25C (72F to 77F) or higher in places. Thursday will probably be slightly cooler but still in the high teens. Wednesday warmth: Most of England and Wales will enjoy sunshine over the next few days with temperatures hitting 24C later this week . Peak District awakening: The morning mist looking out across the Derbyshire village of Foolow, near Grindleford, which woke to a frost . Going for a walk: A deer in the morning mist near Foolow in Derbyshire yesterday, as Britons prepared for the warmest weather of the year so far . ‘There is a cold air mass arriving on Thursday night but it is expected to stay dry well into next week. After that we can be less certain.’ The spell of warm weather, which has now lasted more than a week, has seen people flocking to the nation’s beaches. Among them were swimmers in the South-West who were stunned to see giant jellyfish in the waters. Barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to six feet long, were spotted near Hope Cove in south Devon. The species are usually found in the sunnier climes of the Mediterranean, but the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant that more plankton becomes available and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore. The species is harmless to humans, but with the weather warming up then other jellyfish could be heading our way. Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Devon vet Rupert Kirkwood, whose son Henry had an encounter with one of the jellyfish while kayaking, said: ‘No doubt they are encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. I have never seen them so early in the year. Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year.’ After the bad smog seen late last week in the South-East, the air will be relatively clear for most parts over the next few days.

Over the water: Sunrise near Cullercoats bay in North Tyneside, as Britain basked in the hottest temperatures of the year so far . But pollution levels will increase again on Thursday and Friday, particularly in the South-West, where Cornwall and Devon are expected to see fumes rise to dangerous levels. The Met Office three-month contingency forecast for public officials predicts that there is an average chance of a warmer than usual summer. But thankfully the chances of it being much colder than usual is just 10 per cent. A spokesman said: ‘Unfortunately, the weather we get in April doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about the kind of summer we can expect. ‘We’re still in the midst of spring, so it’s far too early to say what the months of June, July and August may hold.’ Ladbrokes spokesman David Williams said yesterday: ‘The money flooding in on weather bets is unusual and has taken us a bit by surprise. ‘This is the first time we have seen quite significant sums wagered on this specific bet - so obviously people out there sense something hot is coming.’ And Nicola McGeady from Coral added: 'The British public are obsessed with the weather and that is reflected in the interest in weather betting.' Hot day: These graphics show the cloud coverage and temperatures tomorrow, with the South East expected to have the best weather . Arriving: The predicted hot weather this week is the result of a plume of warm air heading towards the UK from the south west . Green for cold, red for hot: These graphics from Netweather show the forecast temperatures for tomorrow (left) and Wednesday (right) A third of weather bets to Ladbrokes have come from punters in the South East - the area that has enjoyed the best conditions over the past week. And the bookmaker said its biggest bet of the year so far has been £1,000 on 2015 to be the hottest year on record at 8/1 - placed in January. Meanwhile, Coral - MailOnline's official betting partner - said it has even had a request from someone asking to bet on rain every day this summer. The Met Office has confirmed that hotter-than-average temperatures are more than twice as likely than below-average conditions until June. It said in a long-range forecast that ‘much of the tropical Pacific Ocean remains warmer than average and close to El Nino thresholds’. El Nino - the warming of Pacific sea surface temperatures - can trigger drought in south-east Asia and Australia as well as floods in South America. The Met Office says most climate models ‘now suggest that sea surface temperatures will exceed El Nino thresholds in late spring or early summer’. With Britain set to bask in its hottest temperatures of the year so far this week, thousands of parents and children are expected to head to the beach. But firefighters have warned those thinking about stripping off and diving into the water - with more than 650 water-related deaths in the UK in 2013. The act, known as ‘tombstoning’, can lead to people suffering ‘cold water shock’ when the air temperature is much higher than that of the water. London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Peter Cowup said: ‘Rivers, lakes and canals may look inviting, especially on a hot day and after a drink. ‘But it’s important to realise that open water has hidden dangers that can hurt you and at worse, kill you.’ On the first-ever Drowning Prevention and Water Safety Week, firefighters added that the 16-30 age group was worst-hit by water deaths in 2013. Giant jellyfish are being spotted off Britain earlier than normal thanks to the warm weather, it was claimed yesterday. Kayaker Rupert Kirkwood, a seasoned sea watcher, was stunned to see the giant creatures off Hope Cove in Devon. The barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to 6ft long, were pictured floating next to Mr Kirkwood’s kayak in the sun-drenched blue waters. Up close: Rupert Kirkwood's son Henry had this encounter with a barrel jellyfish near Hope Cove off the coast of south Devon . The species are usually found in more tropical areas such as the Mediterranean Sea. But the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant more plankton is available - and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore.

Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Floating: The dustbin lid-shaped species is harmless to humans but with the weather warming up experts say more could be heading our way . The Red Cross says that anyone who does get stung should not try to use urine to provide relief as the healing properties of this are an urban myth. Vinegar is said to be far more effective. Vet Mr Kirkwood said: ‘No doubt they [are] encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. ‘I have never seen them so early in the year. Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year.’","Tomorrow will be week's warmest day and Met Office says above-average temperatures are forecast until June .

The Brazilian midfielder was sent off for Internacional after a first-half off-the-ball shove on Ypiranga Erechim striker Otacilio Neto that also saw his opponent sent off for retaliating with an elbow. But fortunately for Anderson, his colleague Fabricio stole the limelight by swearing at his own fans and becoming the third player to be shown the red card, reducing Internacional to nine men in the 1-1 draw in Porto Alegre.

While some players offered their hands in apology to the fans after being repeatedly booed, Fabricio took a different route and showed two middle fingers to the crowd leaving referee Luis Teixeira Rocha with no choice but to give him his marching orders. The 28-year-old left back reacted by tearing off his shirt, throwing it to the floor and shouting 'I'm leaving, I'm leaving,' as he walked down the tunnel. He has already been suspended until the end of the week by his club. Anderson ended his seven-and-a-half year association with United in February by signing a four-year deal with Internacional, but his return to Brazil has not gone as planned. Internacional's Fabricio was also sent off later in the game for aiming his middle fingers at booing fans . Fabricio threw his shirt to the ground after being shown the red card and shouted 'I'm leaving, I'm leaving' Having missed a penalty on his debut, he was substituted later in February after just 36 minutes needing oxygen while playing in the high-altitude Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz. While Internacional sit top of the table in the Campeonato Gaucho, Anderson has faced a familiar struggle for fitness despite making eight appearances since his move.

A police officer who allegedly 'loves playing with dead bodies' has been accused of 'tickling' the feet and yanking on the head and toes of a dead man who had been recently shot killed by cops. Aaron Stringer, of the Bakersfield, California, Police Department, reportedly said 'tickle tickle' as he ran his fingers along the soles of the feet of Ramiro James Villegas, a 22-year-old whom officers killed the same day. A trainee police officer who was with him at the time told how Stringer then pulled on the corpse's toes, and pulled his head back and forth while discussing rigor mortis after the shooting on November 13. According to the Bakersfield Californian, he then said that he 'loves playing with dead bodies' and later told her to lie about what she'd seen. Stringer has been on paid administrative leave from the department since it started investigating the chilling accusations in November. Villegas was shot dead by police after crashing his car in a high-speed chase, ABC23 reported. Officers say they gunned him down after he got out of the car and reached for his waistband, raising fears that he had a gun. It later became clear that he wasn't armed. Stringer, who filed a police report about the day's activities, mentioned interviewing witnesses alongside trainee Lindy DeGeare, who eventually blew the whistle on the alleged corpse manipulation. Shot dead: Ramiro James Villegas, 22, had been shot dead on November 13 by Bakersfield Police after a car chase. Stringer allegedly 'played' with his body as it lay under a bloodied sheet . Let in: Stringer was allowed to see the body by a nurse at the Kern Medical Center, above . She said Stringer volunteered them to head to the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield to help identify the body. It was there that a nurse gave them the passcode to the morgue where Villegas was being held. She said that when Stringer suggested she take a look at the body, she presumed it was part of legitimate training. Under California law, police officers are allowed to look at dead bodies to assess wounds, but are not supposed to handle them. According to the Bakersfield California, local prosecutors considered charging Stringer but dropped the case due to insufficient evidence. He is currently being investigated internally by the police department. A lawyer for the Villegas family said they are also 'very close' to filing a suit of their own.

Speaking up in support of him, the AFR's Geoff Winestock wrote on the social media site: 'Ridiculous. Frightening. I also think Anzacs were racist yobs and Anzac Day is a death cult.

After a public backlash against McIntyre's comments,  SBS Managing Director Michael Ebeid and Director of Sport, Ken Shipp said in a joint statement that his 'highly inappropriate and disrespectful' comments have 'caused his on-air position at SBS to become untenable.' 'Mr McIntyre’s actions have breached the SBS Code of Conduct and social media policy and as a result, SBS has taken decisive action to terminate Mr McIntyre’s position at SBS, with immediate effect.' McIntyre's comments sparked outrage late on Anzac day, with Communications Minister Malcolm Turnball calling them 'despicable remarks' and social media users taking to twitter to spread the #sackScottMcIntre hashtag. In his tweets, the SBS football journalist condemned Anzac day as an 'imperialist invasion.' McIntyre referred to the Anzac's landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey . 'We remember and commemorate our ANZACs': SBS Michael Ebeid was quick to distance the broadcaster from McIntyre's comments on Saturday evening, saying they are 'not at all the views of @SBS' 'The cultification of an imperialist invasion of a foreign nation that Australia had no quarrel with is against all ideals of modern society,' McIntyre tweeted, referring to the Anzac's landing on Turkey's Gallipoli peninsula.

489,f555b81fb888354a9a83ba9acc1bdb18791441ca,"(CNN)Saturday at the Masters, like any PGA tournament, has been dubbed 'Moving Day'. It's the day after the fat has been cut and the big dogs make their move up -- or occasionally down -- the leader board. Players rose and players fell away on Moving Day at the 2015 Masters. Rory McIlroy went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable Grand Slam on Sunday night. But he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par. Woods comeback? A rejuvenated Tiger Woods showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too. A huge improvement, but still a long way from him wearing the green jacket again. ""It could have been a super low today,"" a disappointed Woods said after his round. ""All in all. It should have been two shots better."" Phil Mickelson powered around the course, threatening to challenge too, finishing on eleven under. As did a late Justin Rose surge, where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place. In the end, there was lots of moving, but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble Jordan Spieth. Infallible . The 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at Augusta. His infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from Dallas, Texas a five shot lead going in to the third round. That has happened only three times at Augusta before, and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win. Spieth's 15 birdies are just 10 away from Phil Mickelson's Masters mark set in 2001. He could also break Tiger Woods 270 set in 1997. As it happened, Spieth played a steady, almost conservative round. When he made the occasional mistake, like the bogey at 15, he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole. As his third round came to a close the birdies flowed, his putting impeccable. The only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17. Echos of 1996? When reminded of some of the great Augusta comebacks, including Nick Faldo's 11 shot swing in 1996, Tiger Woods still believes anything is possible. ""It really is,"" he said. ""We saw what happened in 1996. You never know. It depends on the conditions."" He is, of course, right. As Greg Norman knows only too well, anything can happen on the final day. But that kind of crescendo also depends on Spieth experiencing a Greg Norman-style meltdown. Spieth's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope. Yet, for all the movement of Mickelson, Woods, Rose and McIlroy, they made just a one shot dent into Spieth's second round lead. He will begin Sunday four shots ahead.","Jordan Spieth holds lead in 2015 Masters .

John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain. His family feared the worst after discovering a note describing how much he missed his wife of 63 years and how he could not live without her. Double tragedy: John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, pictured together on their wedding anniversary, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain . Nottinghamshire Police launched an appeal in a bid to track down the grandfather-of-three on the day he disappeared from his home in St Ann's, Nottingham. Today officers confirmed a body pulled from the River Trent on April 15 by a specialist underwater search unit was sadly that of the missing pensioner. His family believe he may have killed himself at the picturesque beauty spot where the devoted couple enjoyed going for a walk. Message: Mr Lord's daughter Alison said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all' and described how he could not live without his wife . Mr Lord's last known moments were also captured on CCTV as he parked his white Toyota Yaris car near close to the Trent at 3.15am on April 6. The footage then shows the pensioner walking toward a bridge, which was the last sighting of him. His daughter, Alison Lord, 56, said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all.' Speaking before his death, the teaching assistant, who lives in Bulwell, Nottingham, added: 'He did leave a note. 'It said he couldn't live without June, and he apologised and said ""love to all"". 'It was completely out of character for him to get up and drive his car in the middle of the night.' Ms Lord said her parents, who were members of a local church, had been 'inseparable' and her mum's death had left the whole family devastated. A Nottinghamshire Police spokesperson said: 'The body of a man found in the River Trent on April 15, 2015, has been confirmed as that of missing John Lord. 'Mr Lord, 86, went missing from his home in St Ann's on Monday, 6 April. 'His body was recovered at around 11am on April 15 by Nottinghamshire Police's Underwater Search Unit.

Sportsmail revealed City would listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to overhaul an ageing squad at the end of a faltering campaign. Toure is determined not to be forced out but the Chilean, speaking ahead of Sunday's visit of West Ham, acknowledged the midfielder had underperformed and dismissed claims he should be given a rest. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has come in for criticism for his performances this season . Manuel Pellegrini has admitted he has been disappointed by the Ivory Coast midfielder's level . ‘I don’t think he’s happy with his performance this year — and nor am I,’ said Pellegrini. ‘He doesn’t need a break.’ Toure, who has two years left on a £220,000-a-week deal, has come in for criticism amid the collapse of City’s Premier League defence. But Pellegrini, who faces questions over his own future, said the 31-year-old would be backed. ‘He’s a very important player and he will have my support until the end of the season,’ he said. City, who have taken just 18 points from the last available 39, take on Sam Allardyce’s side knowing that defeat will leave fifth-placed Liverpool with the chance to close the gap to one point with victory at West Brom next weekend. City will also face the Hammers without captain Vincent Kompany, who could miss the rest of the campaign with a muscle injury. With his manager in the firing line, City goalkeeper Joe Hart insisted the players should take responsibility. ‘People have been disappointed in their own performances,’ said the England No 1. ‘We’ve let the manager down a few times and we’ve baffled ourselves because we feel like we’ve got the quality to beat anyone and that’s not been the case.’ City boss Pellegrini has vowed to support Toure until at least the end of the season . Sportsmail revealed that Manchester City will listen to offers for Toure in the summer . Hart added that Pellegrini retained the backing of the dressing room. ‘He’s been great,’ Hart said. ‘He’s hard, he kind of says it how it is and you can’t ask for much more than that from a manager.’ Pellegrini, however, said: ‘The players have responsibility but I choose the players.’ Meanwhile Sam Allardyce has warned Aaron Cresswell not to make the same mistake as others amid interest from Chelsea and Manchester City. Manchester City want to sign West Ham left back Aaron Cresswell in the summer . Sam Allardyce has warned Cresswell not to make same mistake as other English players by moving to City . Allardyce believes the 25-year-old is an attractive prospect after a fine season at West Ham and because he can help clubs fill homegrown player quotas. ‘Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair spent time at City but did not play a great deal,’ Allardyce wrote in his Evening Standard column. ‘The decision for a player like Sinclair is would he be willing to join another club in a permanent deal if it meant less money?’","Sportsmail revealed Manchester City would listen to offers for Yaya Toure .

493,c52340cb2df01c33f99b739f23454e56bc072bdf,"Catania, Italy (CNN)The boat that sank in the Mediterranean over the weekend with hundreds of migrants on board may have capsized after being touched or swamped by a cargo ship that came to its aid, a U.N. official said. Carlotta Asami, a spokeswoman for the United Nations' refugee agency, made the comments to CNN early Tuesday after she and two of her colleagues had spoken to multiple survivors from the disaster who arrived in Catania, Italy. ""They say that there was a point in which they were very close and probably what happened is that, you know, a big ship creating a big wave -- they were approaching in a very strong manner and they lost balance,"" Asami said. The account she offered differs from that provided by Italian authorities on Sunday. They said that as the cargo ship King Jacob approached late Saturday, migrants on the smaller boat moved to one side, hoping to be saved, and caused the vessel to capsize. Mark Clark -- a communications executive representing OSM Maritime Group, the company that manages the King Jacob -- denied that the cargo ship caused the migrant boat to capsize. He said he also believed that people on the migrant boat rushed to one side, causing many to fall off. The cargo ship was going very slowly as it approached, hardly making any waves, Clark told CNN. It deployed rescue boats, a gangway, nets and life rings, he said. The conflicting accounts of the chaotic events highlight the challenges faced by commercial vessels that are often called upon to help in the escalating migrant boat crisis in the Mediterranean. Asami said the survivors whom she and her colleagues spoke to were ""consistent"" in what they were saying. She said their accounts made it ""credible to think"" that between 800 and 850 people were on board the boat that capsized roughly 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya. Previous estimates had put the number of people aboard anywhere between 700 and 950. Italian authorities, who have been coordinating the rescue effort, say only 28 survivors were rescued and 24 bodies have been recovered. The King Jacob, whose crew members are all from the Philippines, saved 22 of the survivors, according to Clark. The cause of the shipwreck is part of Italian authorities' investigation, said Giovanni Salvi, Catania's public prosecutor. Investigators want to study the King Jacob's voyage data recorder and find the wreck of the sunken boat, he told a news conference Monday. The likely toll makes the sinking the deadliest known disaster involving migrants crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa. Many of the victims are feared to be still trapped inside the sunken boat. Asami said the survivors told her and her colleagues that they were all on the highest part of the overcrowded boat, while many people were down in the lowest area. Italian authorities said Sunday that an unidentified Bangladeshi survivor had told them that the smugglers had locked many people inside the lower levels of the vessel. Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily on Monday, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico. They were the boat's Tunisian captain and a Syrian crew member, said Salvi, the Catania prosecutor. Italian police identified the two suspects through questioning survivors aboard the coast guard vessel that brought them to Catania, Salvi said, according to Italian media. The sinking appears to be the worst among an intensifying spate of migrant boat disasters in the Mediterranean to which European governments are struggling to respond. Vast numbers of people fleeing violence and poverty have been setting out on the risky journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sharp increase this month in the numbers in need of rescue. The number of deaths has also skyrocketed. The International Organization for Migration said Monday that more than 1,100 people were estimated to have drowned in the waters between Libya and Italy just in the past week. It reported Monday that three other migrant boats could be in distress in international waters. Shipping companies recently warned that European governments are putting what they say is an unfair burden on their vessels to come to the aid of migrant boats in trouble. ""We believe it is unacceptable that the international community is increasingly relying on merchant ships and seafarers to undertake more and more large-scale rescues, with single ships having to rescue as many 500 people at a time,"" the European Community Shipowners Associations said in a letter to EU leaders last month. ""Commercial ships are not equipped to undertake such large-scale rescues, which also create serious risks to the safety, health and welfare of ships' crews who should not be expected to deal which such situations,"" the letter said. Commercial ships rescued more than 40,000 people in the Mediterranean last year, according to the International Organization for Migration. That's higher than the more than 35,000 people saved by the Italian Coast Guard but lower than the 80,000 rescued by the Italian Navy, which was running a special program, Mare Nostrum, for most of the year. European Union ministers met Monday in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis. ""We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,"" said Federica Mogherini, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security police. Mogherini told CNN that the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees. ""We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,"" Mogherini said. ""My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died."" But some groups said European officials were offering too little too late. ""What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,"" said Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of Save The Children. ""With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss,"" Forsyth said in a statement. ""Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics."" CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Catania, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

494,5e32bb786b50077226fb4545ad8f5832d21d00ee,"A bloodstained document revealing a life-or-death episode that could have derailed the whole US space programme of the 1960s is tipped to sell for £80,000 ($120,000). The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge £80,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity (EVA), before having to come back in, which he said was 'the saddest moment of my life'. But the hatch to get out had proved difficult to open and it was equally difficult to close when White was back inside. It's thought one of them cut their hand or finger on the hatch locking mechanism and their blood ended up on the checklist after they removed their gloves while safely inside. Had the pair not been able to lock the hatch after themselves, they wouldn't have been able to re-enter Earth's atmosphere and would have been lost in space. And had that worse case scenario happened, it could easily have scuppered the Apollo missions that followed including the first of the moon landings four years later in 1969. Edward White, pictured, became the first US astronaut to perform a spacewalk on 3 June 1965. He spent 20 minutes in space, and said coming back in was 'the saddest moment of my life'. As it was the first spacewalk, there were a number of complications. White used a small jet propulsion unit to move around in space . The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. Shown is the first page of the checklist (left) and the Suit Integrity Check (right) for the spacecraft . The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. On the left is part of the checklist used for leaving the spacecraft, and on the right, part of the checks the astronaut leaving had to go through . Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. Pictured is the later Gemini 7 in orbit, as seen from Gemini 6 during a rendezvous mission in December 1965 . Checklists from space missions are said to be highly collectable items because they flew in space and were so vital to the astronauts. The spacewalk checklist for the Gemini 4 mission of 1965 belonged to McDivitt who gave it to a friend after signing it many years ago. The document is now being sold at auction to mark the 50th anniversary of the historic mission. Cassandra Hatton, of auctioneers Bonhams which is selling the item, said: 'The Gemini 4 mission was the first time [an American] walked in space and it was a huge step in the development of the space programme. Gemini 4 (pictured) launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board . Shown are astronauts Edward H. White II (left) and James A. McDivitt, command pilot for Gemini 4 . 'We knew we could get into space but until this point we didn't know if we could walk and float around out there. Jim McDivitt and Ed White's achievement is second only to landing on the moon. 'The checklist was vital for making sure things didn't go wrong and they didn't get sucked out into space. 'They had a difficult time in getting back in the capsule afterwards as the hatch got stuck. There was a problem with the latch on the hatch. It was a really scary, life or death moment. 'If they hadn't been able to get the hatch closed they would have died in space. It would have been the first major space programme disaster which could have jettisoned the whole space programme.'

During the Reclaim Australia rallies on the Easter weekend, anti-racism protester Jacob King was snapped staring into the eyes of a bald man with a swastika tattooed behind his ear. Mr King, from Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia he had his arms spread out because he thought the man was going to attack him and his fellow protesters at Federation Square. Anti-racism protester Jacob King, from Melbourne, had a face off with a neo-Nazi at the Easter weekend's Reclaim Australia rallies . Mr King was raised in Melbourne and says he lived in a multicultural part of the Victorian capital where he was exposed to racial tensions . The anti-racism protester said he learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to 'unlearn' these views' 'A few scuffles broke out as a result of those trying to push and fight their way through the picket lines,' he said. 'I remember looking at the bald man from the photo and it seemed to me that he and his group were there solely to be violent and express incoherent hatred, which took away from the already limited opportunities to engage in civilised discussion. 'I have however felt this kind of anger before, and this understanding produced in me a moment of unexpected compassion for him. 'I placed myself in between him and the anti-racism protesters. My arms were outstretched to keep people back and when the man got in my face I was expecting him to attack me. But he didn't. 'As he began to relax I told him there would be no more fighting today. I wasn't expecting him to comply so easily, but I respect him for doing so.' Mr King said he was born and had grown up in a multicultural part of Melbourne, where he had been on the giving and receiving ends of 'racial prejudice and bigoted views'. 'I learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to unlearn and re-learn enough to accept that many of my simplified views were irrational,' he said. 'I have learned that the vast majority of Australian Muslims have come to Australia to improve their lives, contribute to our society and are against the extremist interpretations of their faith which they are so often accused of holding. Mr King said he had spread out his arms to protect his fellow protesters because he thought the man and his group was going to attack them . Wearing a Harley Davidson sleeveless hoodie, which showed off his sleeve of tattoos, the bald man attempted to start a fight with the protesters against racism, who stood against him in defiance . 'I attended the anti-racism rally because I recognise that the issues raised by the rally co-ordinators are a direct result of the scapegoating and fear mongering of Muslims and other minorities by many in the corporate mainstream media and government. 'I firmly believe these divisions in our society are distracting us from the more immediate issues that should be of greater concern to all Australians.' Numerous images emerged showing fiery scenes around the nation, but the most striking picture was taken by photographer Kenji Wardenclyffe who captured Mr King during the Melbourne protest against the 'Islamisation' of Australia. The dramatic scenes occurred after Reclaim Australia, an anti-Islam group, organised protests at major cities across Australia, which were countered by anti-racism activists who held rallies in the same locations. The Reclaim Australia event in Melbourne was also crashed by neo-nazis, who spectacularly clashed with anti-racism groups. 'It was very intense,' Kenji Wardenclyffe told Daily Mail Australia. 'The neo-nazi definitely seemed to be instigating, trying to start a fight with the anti-racism group. The other man in the photo stepped in and was trying to keep the peace. 'He kept his hands open, he was trying to stop a fight from breaking out.' The violent intent of the bald man was proven elsewhere at the rally, when he was photographed with one fist gripping another protester's shirt and the other raised to punch the man in the face. Mr Wardenclyffe said he was pushed around by protesters throughout the day, and some of his camera equipment was broken by people attempting to stop him from taking photos. 'It was a very angry atmosphere - it definitely seemed some of the people on the Reclaim Australia side were there looking to start a fight,' he said. 'It was very tense.' Violent intent: At the rally, the man involved in the standoff was seen trying to throw a punch at another protester as the scene descended into violence . One man appeared to be knocked out cold in the melee and was left lying on the ground . The identification of Jacob King comes after a Federal Government MP reported a group 'socialist ratbags' who were seen burning the Australian flag at the rally to the Human Rights Commission. The trio were at a Reclaim Australia demonstration, the same rally where Mr King was photographed. George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' who burnt the flag while protesting against the Reclaim Australia group. 'I have asked the Racial Discrimination Commissioner to investigate the protests to see if they are unlawful under Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act,' Mr Christensen said. 'According to the Act, it is unlawful to perform any action in public that is likely to offend people of a particular race, religion, or national background. If sections of the Act can be applied to one race or nationality it must apply to all, whether a minority or the majority,' he also wrote. The rally was just one of a dozen which took place in cities across Australia on the Easter long weekend, organised by anti-Islam group Reclaim Australia.

George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland (left) revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' (right) In a video of the event, it also appears to show the moment a man throw a punch at the head of a female anti-racism protester. Despite Reclaim Australia's promise of a peaceful protest, a number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika appeared at the event and attempted to intimidate anti-racism protesters. Reclaim Australia describe themselves as 'patriotic Australians' who protest against Sharia Law, Halal tax and Islam. They say they want 'compulsory singing of our national anthem weekly in every school in Australia' and want the government to 'refuse entry to anyone who has fought overseas against our ADF or minimum 15 years jail term.' Police were forced to separate  supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country. Crowd numbers continued to grow throughout the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics after the ugly clashes. Police were forced to separate Reclaim Australia supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country . Speaking to Buzzfeed, photographer Wardenclyffe said one of the anti-racism protesters stood out in front of the rest to stop him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi appeared and pushed through the crowd and began to yell at the (left-wing protestors),' Mr Wardenclyffe said. 'The neo-Nazi then got in the face of the man in my photo with sunglasses who had moved into a position to prevent him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi yelled at him in a manner which seemed to be an attempt to start a fight, but the guy with sunglasses remained calm and didn't engage.' A clash of anti-Islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in Melbourne . Melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters . It comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests . There was never a violent exchange between the groups however the men with the swastika's moved through the crowd taunting the anti-racism protesters. The clash comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups mocked  protests being held around Australia last week. However, organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account. Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics . Across Australia, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, but Sydney and Melbourne drew the biggest crowd . 'It's not us,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Ours is @reclaim_aus.' Across the country, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, with events in Sydney and Melbourne appearing to have drawn the biggest crowds. About 500 people attended the rally held in Martin Place, Sydney, which included speeches from former Australia Defence League member Shermon Burgess and Rise Up!

497,8eb45776779a54e6f46da776598714065cb2be5c,"A man strangled his friend to death in a rage after the friend admitted that he had been molesting young girls and thought 'one of them was starting to like it,' a jury heard this week. Robert Mccombs told a court in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Wednesday that Steven Carl Day admitted to him and his roommate Roger Musick that he molested a young relative and that he was molesting other young girls. 'Day said he thought one of the girls was starting to like it,' Mccombs testified. Witnessed the confession: Robert Mccombs (left) said that when Steven Carl Day admitted to him and his roommate Roger Musick (right) that he was a child molester, Musick strangled him to death . Shocking revelation: Steven Carl Day was allegedly murdered on December 18, 2013 after he told two friends that he molested young girls and that he thought, 'one of them was starting to like it' Day met up with Musick and Mccombs at a bar on December 18 to have drinks for Mccombs' birthday and that's where the shocking confession allegedly took place. 'My jaw just dropped that he would just admit it, blurt it out like that. I looked over at Roger and he was just as shocked as I was.' Musick, 39, mouthed the words 'I want to kill him,' Mccombs told the court. Mccombs told the court that the next thing he knew, Mccombs was attacking Day. Mccombs describes seeing Musick holding Day in a choke hold on the floor. 'When I saw him in the choke-hold, his arms were down, his eyes were bulging. He wasn't moving,' Mccombs told the court. The Detroit Free Press reports that the roommates put Day's dead body into the back of Mccombs' van and headed north where they found a ridge to drop the body. Addiction: After the murder in 2013, friends of Day said he was an Army veteran who had struggled in recent years while battling an alcohol addiction . Mccombs said that the two had breakfast before parting ways. Musick went to work and Mccombs went to their home to get rid of Day's belongings. He claims that he put Day's backpack and coat in a trash can at a nearby shopping center and then rode Day's bike to an abandoned car wash near the home. When detectives found Day's hat and cell phone in Mccomb's van, both he and Musick were charged with murder. Days later the charges were dropped but they were both later arrested and charged with tampering with evidence. Open container: This mug shot of Steven Carl Day, who described by friends as an alcoholic, was taken in 2011 after he was charged with consuming alcohol in public . Mccomb's was released from jail in Early March after more than a year behind bars for the 'tampering with evidence' charge. Musick was also about to be released but police later found there was enough evidence to charge him with Day's murder. Musick was returned to the Kent County Jail without bond. Kent County Sheriff's Detective Martin Albert said he found evidence at Day's home after the 2013 murder that suggested he he had admitted to molesting a five-year-old relative, 35 years ago. At the time of his death, Day had never been charged or prosecuted for any molestation crime. Though, Day was taking part in the Salvation Army's 12-step 'Turning Point' program during which Day confessed in a letter to the molestation. The program is intended to help participants confront their demons, particularly with addictions. Detective Albert testified after the murder that Day's sister was helping with the murder investigation and  told him her brother had admitted the molestation of a five-year-old relative about 35 years ago. A detective who analyzed the cell phones of both Mr Musick and Mr McCombs told Michigan's M LIve text messages had been sent between the two the day the body was found. McCombs allegedly wrote: 'You OK? The world is a better place today and one little girl can sleep tonight because her monster is gone.' Musick allegedly replied: 'True'.","Steven Carl Day's confession over drinks that he molested young girls led to his murder, Robert Mccombs, the roommate of the alleged murder testified .

Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 at the Bernabeu, and their Portuguese talisman managed the first five-goal haul of his career. His record of 36 league goals for the season overtook Lionel Messi's 32 strikes, and put him in the incredible position of having scored more goals than 53 of the 98 teams in Europe's top five leagues this season. Cristiano Ronaldo scored an incredible five goals against Granada to lift his tally for the season to 36 . Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 .

There are nine teams in the Barclays Premier League who have managed fewer goals in the league than Cristiano Ronaldo has this season. They are: . Stoke City, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley and Leicester City. Ronaldo took some flak last month after a series of poor performances for Real, but his goalscoring has never waivered and even through a difficult period he managed six goals in 10 games, the sort of record most strikers can only dream of. And his displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Newcastle United, Malaga, Borussia Dortmund, Torino and Lille. The first three of his five goals against Granada marked the quickest hat-trick of his career, coming in just eight first half minutes. Another followed 16 minutes later, and his last came 35 minutes after that. Ronaldo's displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Lille . It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he spoke of his delight afterwards . Lionel Messi and Barcelona came out on top in El Clasico but he has fewer league goals than Ronaldo . Borussia Dortmund, who can boast Marco Reus among their ranks, have fewer goals than the Real talisman . While Ronaldo overtook Messi on the goalscoring charts, the hat-trick - which could have been doubled - levelled the Argentine's record of 24 La Liga trebles. He almost matched Real legend Alfredo Di Stefano's 28 hat-tricks for Los Blancos in what was their biggest league win in 48-and-a-half years. It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he posted on Twitter after the game, saying: 'Happy to have scored 5 goals with this excellent team work. Thank you for all your support.' If the critics still see Ronaldo as greedy, it certainly paid off at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.

Officials from both circuits had voiced concern that time was running out to organise the race, which was scheduled to take place over the weekend of July 17-19. A short FIA statement said no agreement could be reached with Ecclestone, the commercial rights holder (CRH). 'The German Grand Prix has been withdrawn as the CRH and promoter did not reach agreement,' the statement said.

As a result of the Land Rover Defender's demise, there could be a boom in sales of a Russian badge which was a butt of many jokes in the Soviet era – the Lada. Lada's 4x4 Niva has long been the car that bucked the trend of laughing at the Russian carmaker and has won fans around the world thanks to its robust nature and chunky looks. We take a look.

Patriotic Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured) drove a Lada Niva back in 2009 — but fitted it with a German engine .","This 4x4 from Russia is a fraction of the price of a new Land Rover .
Off-road, the Niva is in its element, with low and highrange gears .
But, forget luxuries because the Niva is an unabashed frills-free zone .
A highly capable, ruftytufty 4x4 from Russia — for a fraction of the price of a new Land Rover.
It's a confident charmer that stands out from the crowd, with high suspension, pressed steel wheels, Soviet-style looks and real rarity value. Expect to get gawped at: someone offered to buy mine on its second trip out. Always fun.
Now available in the UK from Niva imports through its dealer, BB Motors, in Corby, Northamptonshire (01536 202207, lada4x4.co.uk).
On the road, the basic 1.7-litre petrol engine (your only option) is deafeningly noisy, but tolerably smooth. Power steering, manageable dimensions and a tight turning circle make it reasonably practical for the supermarket or school run.
The seats are comfy and thanks to a high driving position and large wing mirrors, all-round visibility is good. Top speed is 91 mph.
Off-road, the Niva is in its element, with low and highrange gears, differential lock and a sturdy monocoque construction. It is lighter and more sprightly in the mud than many big-name utility 4x4s, with 220mm ground clearance, a 600mm wading depth and a climbing ability of up to 58 per cent. Tall, slender tyres give it an added advantage when things get mucky.
You won't have to agonise over pages of extras... they're more or less nonexistent. This is a very basic utility vehicle, after all.
Choose in white, blue, green or red, then decide whether you'd like the snorkel or snow plough (really) attachments. An LPG option is available for an extra £999 — but you lose boot space.
Reasonable fuel economy at 33mpg and affordable to insure — once you've explained exactly what it is. Meets Euro 5 emissions standards. The heated blower, presumably designed with Siberia in mind, has plenty of muscle for icy winter mornings.
Also available in a compact van format (£10,590, excluding VAT and road tax).
Spartan on the inside. Forget luxuries such as radios, cup-holders, central locking and electric windows — the Niva is an unabashed frills-free zone. The upside of its simplicity is that the plastic interior is easy to mop down after a day in the mud, and there's not much to break or go wrong.
There are only four seatbelts and a slightly pokey boot.
Don't trust the petrol gauge, which regularly aims to deceive.
No warranty is offered as standard — although a two-year plan is coming soon — and spares may need to be imported (BB Motors will assist).
Only available in lefthand drive — unless you put in an order for more than 500 of them!
Shhhh! You didn't hear it from me. But patriotic Russian President Vladimir Putin made a big play of driving a Lada Niva back in 2009 — but fitted it with a German engine."
501,c852f4bc83e5c3d2672ebeb6eeae27bf94b49078,"A judge said he had to deal with his own 'revulsion' as he jailed four care home assistants who called their dementia residents 'fugly' and told one she was living in a brothel. The women, who worked at the dementia unit of the Bupa-run facility, in Bretton, Cambridgeshire, told one woman she was going to be killed. Another confused patient was told she was living in a brothel and should expect male visitors. Chloe Pearsall, 26, (left) and Nicole Howley, 25 (right) committed the acts of abuse at the care home throughout 2013 they have been jailed along with their colleagues Joanne Fisher, 36, and Barbara Holcroft, 63 . All four workers ‘systematically’ abused residents until a whistleblower reported them to bosses. Nicole Howley, 25, was jailed for two years this week after she was found guilty of two charges of ill-treating a person as a carer under the Mental Capacity Act. Colleagues Chloe Pearsall, 26, Joanne Fisher, 36, and Barbara Holcroft, 63, were convicted of one count of the same offence and sentenced to nine months each. Sentencing the women, Judge Sean Enright said he had ‘put aside his own personal revulsion’ to find a ‘just, proportionate sentence’. Using the word ‘fugly’ demonstrated the ‘lack of respect’ they showed patients, he added, saying: ‘This was systematic ill-treatment.’ The case highlights the plight of many old and vulnerable people in the care system and hospitals. The Daily Mail has repeatedly called for improved standards under its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. The four workers waged their hate-filled campaign throughout 2013. Wentworth Croft Care Home in Bretton, Cambridgeshire has 156 rooms which offer nursing, residential and dementia care for elderly people. During a trial at Peterborough Magistrates Court earlier this year, co-worker Lanya Edwards described how the women, all from Peterborough, abused one resident with ‘quite advanced’ dementia. Wentworth Croft Care Home in Bretton, Cambridgeshire (pictured) has 156 rooms which offer nursing, residential and dementia care for elderly people . The four workers waged their hate-filled campaign throughout 2013 and told one elderly resident that she was working in a brothel . ‘She would ask where she was a lot. I would say she was in a care home in Peterborough and she would be staying here until she got better,’ she said. ‘But I heard some care assistants tell her she was living in a brothel. She used to get quite worried. It is not a nice thing to hear.’ Miss Edwards said she heard Fisher, Holcroft and Howley taunting the women ‘at least a couple of times a week’. She also said she heard the women calling people ‘fugly’ behind their backs – although another witness, Jessica Skelly, told the court they used the term openly with at least one resident. ‘It was used to her. She used to get distressed and said she would phone the police,’ she said. Describing the vile abuse meted out to the woman who was told she was working in a brothel, she added: ‘Chloe, Jo and Nicole all referred to her as a prostitute… they said she wasn’t pulling her weight.’ Three of the workers regularly referred to one resident as a prostitute and told another she was fugly . After the group were found guilty, magistrates decided to send the case to Peterborough Crown Court for sentencing because their sentencing powers were insufficient to reflect the ‘gravitas of the offences and the vulnerability of the victims’. Andrew Hurst, representing the women on Wednesday, said they continued to deny the offences. They were all dismissed from their jobs in February last year. A spokesman for the care home said: ‘Everyone at the home is deeply shocked by the deplorable behaviour of these experienced carers.’ A fifth carer, Benjamin Appiah, denies ill-treating three women and will stand trial in June.","Judge had to set aside own feelings to give them an appropriate sentence .

504,4a2d24b66bf10b110baba09c6ac004cf3296fe6c,"No footballer has ever been late for kick-off because he was tied up negotiating a new contract. So, from the start, Raheem Sterling’s explanation for the end of his conversations with Liverpool did not stand up. It isn’t the talks that are the distraction. It is the thinking. No player is sat in an office haggling over image rights, only to check his watch at 3.30pm and bolt out of the door. A player may feel uncertainty about his future. His brain may whirl over where he will play next season. Liverpool? Arsenal? Abroad? Yet postponing the process to the end of the season doesn’t solve that issue. If anything, it makes it worse. If Sterling wanted to stop thinking right now, he could sign his new deal or tell Liverpool to come back in a year. He has, after all, got more than two seasons left on his existing arrangement. Raheem Sterling has turned down a new deal with Liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer . Sterling (right) has confirmed that he rejected an offer of £100,000-a-week to stay at Liverpool . The 20-year-old gave an interview to the BBC on Wednesday giving his reasons for his decision . So all Sterling did, the day his advisers ended negotiations until May at the earliest, was complicate his affairs. It is not as if he will be able to forget about the decision in the coming weeks, particularly as his stance appears to have damaged his relationship with Liverpool’s supporters. Without doubt, they were dissatisfied with his attitude even before this week’s ill-conceived BBC interview. As Liverpool’s hopes of a Champions League place next season became increasingly remote with the home defeat against Manchester United, Sterling bore the brunt of the dissent. In truth, his performance was little worse than any of his team-mates that day - but he is the one who is seen as disloyal, as rejecting at the first opportunity the club and manager that have best developed his game. Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers have done well by Sterling. They made him a key player in last season’s title near miss, got him to the World Cup. He owes them a little more respect than has been displayed in recent weeks. He owes them enough to know it is downright rude to talk of being flattered by Arsenal just days before the teams meet. Liverpool are entitled to think it is equally flattering for a club of its stature to offer a salary worth more than £5million annually. Apparently not.

Among the reasons advanced for Sterling’s coldness towards a long-term commitment at Liverpool has been Rodgers’s recent decision to play him at right wing back. This has been a result of injuries and suspensions, rather than a long-term strategy - but it does raise wider questions regarding the mindset of English players, and why many might find their pathway blocked. Would a young player brought up through Ajax’s system, for instance, be so affronted by this temporary change? Why is it the English in particular that see football in straight lines? Sterling has played as a centre forward, a No 10, a wide midfielder and now a wing back. Isn’t this the versatility that we envy in the best foreign teams? Isn’t this an education? Why is it that England produces pigeon-holed full backs or midfielders, and not footballers? Shouldn’t a player - certainly one who wishes to command in excess of £100,000 a week - be able to fill in anywhere? Indeed, shouldn’t he welcome that endorsement from his manager? Arsenal progressed to the 2006 Champions League final at a time when Ashley Cole was injured. In his place through the knockout stages, home and away against Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal, was the 22-year-old French midfielder Mathieu Flamini. He hadn’t played full back in his entire professional career, he said. But he never complained, and Arsenal didn’t concede in any of his six matches. Midfielder Mathieu Flamini (right) was used a full back in Arsenal's run to the 2006 Champions League final . Flamini isn’t a creative in Sterling’s mould - but then right wing back isn’t the same as left back, either. Sterling is still operating as a winger when Liverpool attack. Flamini, a central midfielder, was used strictly as a defender. It wasn’t as if Arsene Wenger was gung-ho in those games: three ended goalless, two in 1-0 victories. Flamini performed with exceptional discipline. One imagines that midfielder Emre Can didn’t sign for Liverpool expecting to be part of a back three. Rodgers first used him as a defender this season against Burnley in December, and he has remained there ever since. Can is German, though, the product of a more intellectually vibrant football culture. World Cup-winning captain Philipp Lahm eagerly switched between holding midfield and full back. Midfield lynchpin Bastian Schweinsteiger began his career as a right winger, while Thomas Muller can play centre forward, support striker, attacking midfielder and winger. Every player will have a favourite position but in England these desires become entrenched. Even the most gifted, such as Steven Gerrard, never seemed entirely at ease with his versatility. Maybe Sterling should spend his time thinking less about his contract and more about the type of footballer he wishes to be; maybe about the type of footballer who can demand more than £100,000 a week. Because that player goes wherever his team needs him — and that makes him worth the coin. Sterling's Liverpool team-mate Emre Can (centre) has been used mainly in defence, despite being a midfielder .","Raheem Sterling has turned down a Liverpool deal worth £100,000-a-week .

We are very confident that we are going to stay in the Premier League but you just never know. If you take your foot off the pedal, this game shocks you. 'There's other teams fighting for their lives as well. 'It's important in the bad times that they stick together as well and I think we've done that. Tim Sherwood is confident Aston Villa can secure their Premier League survival with five games remaining . 'It's not all been plain sailing. We haven't won every game since I've come in. 'We've taken some knocks and took some last-gasp defeats as well so we've managed to brush it aside and bounce back in the following games, so there's enough character in there and enough ability in there to stay in the division.'

506,a4fcad5c94e033d1deb6c8032647cd266fa58afa,"The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was ‘no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident’. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had ‘existed for some time prior to the accident’. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell’s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.’","Martyn Uzzell died instantly when a 4in pothole threw him into path of a car .

Enter 'Retrosweat'. Founded by former NIDA graduate Shannon Dooley, 30, the aerobics classes with a twist are all about 'making fitness fabulous'. Described as 'freestyle aerobic workout,' Retrosweat is inspired by the era of old-school VHS workouts made famous by Jane Fonda, and involves choreography to match the Eighties soundtrack. Scroll down for video . Getting physical: Shannon Dooley has founded 'Retrosweat' - an Eighties-inspired aerobics class in the style of Jane Fonda's iconic workouts . Skin and pins: Typical Retrosweat attire is all about showing off your legs in skimpy Eighties leotards . Pop it like it's hot: A Retrosweat class will have you popping, squatting and grinding to a retro soundtrack . A 50-minute workout, it has 12 dance tracks and Dooley regularly mixes up the soundtrack to keep people excited each week - and on their toes. 'There's a fusion of jogging, jumping, athletic movement and dance - and a lot of huffing and puffing' says Dooley. 'Basically there's a warm up, warm down, both high and medium impact movement that targets all areas of the body. 'There will be a leg track with squats and lunges and an arm track with push ups.' Eighties alter ego: Dooley says class goers  tend to adopt a complete alter ego as their costume collection grows . Iconic: Olivia Newton-John's aerobic anthem Let's Get Physical inspired many a skimpy lycra ensemble . 'Being freestyle though, I like to change up the tracks and let people request songs, but also give people the structure of the same key moves each week.' It also promises to have you 'sweating litres, laughing loads and getting buns of steel and a core to die for.' And according to Dooley, there's nothing else like it on the market. 'What makes it different is it's theatrical - people can come into a space that’s all about the 1980s and escape 2015 for an hour,' says Dooley. 'Not to mention being physically and creatively expressive while getting exercise they need.' And it's not just for those stuck in a Eighties time warp either. Tutti Frutti - In Summer Dooley adds 'Pineapple squat challenge' a modern take on a kettlebell workout . 'The demographic is quite wide. We have girls in their early twenties that come, ladies in their thirties, ladies in their forties who used to listen to Eighties music during high school, women in early sixties who are relieved freestyle movement is back and who used to do it five times a week in the Eighties.' 'Oh and we definitely have men come along too,  they love it.' Overall Dooley says people just like to come along because they love Eighties music, want to put an amazing costume on, feel fabulous - and release endorphins - 'It’s one big healthy party!' When asked where she got her inspiration,  surprisingly it wasn't from watching her mum do Jane Fonda workouts. Diva demographic: Dooley say there's no set demographic - attendees include men and women aged from their twenties to sixties . 'No strangely. My mum was actually an amazing tap dancer so while all my friends were in aerobics classes I watched my mum do tap exams,' says Dooley. 'She is though an amazing choreographer so that’s where I get my inspiration from.' As for attire? 'I wouldn’t turn away anyone who isn’t in a leotard,' laughs Dooley. 'But as people come back, gradually each week they will start to build collection. A leotard from eBay, leg warmers from American Apparel and after a while they build this whole alter ego and when then they will come in wearing a G-string leotard and no one will even blink.' On her own wardrobe, Dooley takes her job very seriously, admitting she's never worn the same outfit twice, 'an I've been teaching for three years - so yes my lycra costumes take up a whole room now' - (65 leotards to be precise). Fit and fun: Dooley says unlike  treadmill workouts, Retrosweat is about having fun and forgetting it's fitness . 'I like to set the standards through my face, hair and body so people feel invited to be themselves,' she says. Aside from the costumes, music and theatrics, Dooley also throws in some novelty competitions and spin off Seventies and Nineties classes to mix it up for regular aerobic goers. 'In summer, we do the pineapple squat challenge - so someone in the room will hold a pineapple in the squat track (which weighs about 2kgs) and it works just like a kettlebell, except your using the resistance of pineapple. Fonda fitspo: Dooley credits Jane Fonda as one of her main sources of inspiration behind Retrosweat . 'When we do Seventies class I will mix it up with a disco ball!' Dooley says the Seventies and Nineties nights she likes to throw in for good measure and to mix up the moves, as well as give herself a break from Eighties decade for a bit. 'Nineties goes off, we dance to fresh prince and that classic song ‘Sing hallelujah!’ So with all this fun and flair, how does the fitness measure up? 'For me, other than getting people to smile, escape life for an hour and enjoy themselves, the best feedback I get is about fitness. People will say, I lost four kilos and I didn't even notice!' says Dooley. 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves': Dooley says those with two left feet won't have any difficulty . 'A lot of exercise these days is scientific, counting reps and scooping protein powder. I respect that but that’s not me. My exercise has always been jumping on my bed and having fun, and I know there is a big group out there that has brains that work the same as mine,' says Dooley. 'People want variation, they want a ballad and they want to go nuts when the chorus hits. And the great thing about using songs is they're only 3.5-4 minutes long so there’s comfort in the fact you’re jumping up and down  but there's ‘just one more chorus’ and then we’ll be done.' So for Dooley it all just boils down to getting people excited and wanting to have a 'bodacious body.' 'I love seeing people improve their quality of life through the magic of music and star jumps - as sentimental as that sounds.' As for those with two left feet, Dooley says you won't have any trouble. Baby one more time: Every now and again a Seventies or Nineties class is thrown into the mix, which Dooley says 'go off' 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves. I think it's much more enjoyable to do simple moves well and enjoy it than struggle with something complicated and not enjoy it. So whether you've never danced or are a dancer who wants to keep their skills up,  Retrosweat is all about simplicity and completely inclusive.' And it seems this 'blast from the past' class is only growing. Dooley now runs additional side business 'Dial-a-sweat' where she takes hens parties for a class, and has travelled all around Sydney from Bowral, Newport and Kirrabilli overlooking the harbour bridge. And with two current locations in Alexandria and Surry Hills that run weekly (and Bondi for a while), Dooley believes the demand is strong and she already has her eyes on even bigger things. 'I want the whole world Retrosweating, that’s the plan.' 'And if I have too much make-up on and have sweat running on my face then that’s all part of it.'","'Retrosweat' aerobics classes allow attendees to 'forget 2015 for an hour'

And concerns are so great that one security source has warned: ‘However much physical security you have, if someone is already in there, there’s nothing you can do to stop them committing an act of sabotage or terrorism.’ MI5 is now giving advice on the risk posed by thousands of employees working in sensitive areas – known as ‘insiders’ – highlighted by the Germanwings disaster. Warning: MI5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in Britain’s nuclear, transport and public services after co-pilot Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people in the Alps plane crash disaster . Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was being treated for depression, was able to override a security system installed on flights following the 9/11 attacks as he flew the aircraft into the ground. Guidance issued by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), a security agency accountable to the director general of MI5, recommends continuous psychological assessment of key employees, with the highest priority given to workers whose jobs pose the greatest risk to the public. But a BA pilot, who has been with the company for several years and flies regularly around the world, claimed the airline did not carry out mental health checks. The pilot, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘British Airways is more interested in checking whether I have a hernia than mental health. ‘There is no testing regarding mental health.’ A BA spokeswoman refused to discuss details of health checks carried out on pilots. The CPNI has identified a number of motives for employees becoming an insider threat, including theft, revenge, a hunger for notoriety, political or religious ideology and fear or coercion, where external pressure is exerted on a worker. Rescue workers and investigators work near debris at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 . A CPNI study showed that three-quarters of insider acts were carried out by employees who had no malicious intent when joining the organisation, but whose loyalties changed after recruitment. Disturbingly, it also found that in many circumstances the workers had been in their organisation for some years before going rogue. Some of the more common insider acts include unauthorised disclosure of information – such as in the case of US whistleblower Edward Snowden – process corruption (where an employee illegitimately alters an internal process for their own ends) and corporate espionage. The security source said: ‘Years ago, the emphasis was on external security. Now ‘‘the insider’’ is the growing threat, as seen in the cases of Edward Snowden and Lubitz. ‘We advise companies to look closely at their personnel. The higher security clearance they gain over their time of employment, the closer they should be monitored.’","Alert issued over rogue workers in nuclear, transport and public services .

511,5411f860a35669db62d2d9baff75f5c76682d33c,"Tom Ince scored two fantastic goals in front of his dad as Derby twice came from behind to share the points in a thrilling 4-4 draw at Huddersfield. Former England and Manchester United midfielder Paul was in the stands as the on-loan Hull player scored two long-range efforts for the visitors, one in each half. Play-off chasing Derby were 1-0 up, 3-1 down and 4-3 behind in an amazing game which also saw Huddersfield have three goals ruled out. Tom Ince (centre) is currently on loan at Derby from Premier League side Hull City and has been in fine form . Huddersfield (4-4-2): Smithies, Smith, Hudson, Lynch, Scannell, Gobern, Coady (Hogg 81), Butterfield, James, Wells (Bunn 88), Miller . Subs not used: Edgar, Murphy, Wallace, Lolley, Billing . Booked: James, Butterfield . Scorers: Gobern 38, Hudson 41, James 45, Wells 72 .

Booked: Dawkins . Scorers: Ince 16, 79, Dawkins 52, Lingard 61 . Referee: Dean Whitestone . Attendance: 15,889 . Ince crashed home a stunning 25-yard drive on 16 minutes seconds after seeing a free-kick from similar distance saved. Derby lost Craig Bryson to injury early on and then Zak Whitbread also went off on 27 minutes. After that Huddersfield, seeking back-to-back home wins against play-off contenders after beating Ipswich last time out, stepped up a gear. Nahki Wells and Ishmael Miller went close before three goals in seven minutes left Derby shell-shocked. There was controversy about Huddersfield's first on 38 minutes when Oscar Gobern appeared to handle Conor Coady's ball into the box. Everybody except Gobern seemed to stop for a flag or whistle but neither came and he hooked in from close range. Gobern, out of contract at the end of the season, last scored for Huddersfield in January 2012. A Mark Hudson header from a Reece James corner deflected into the net off a Derby defender on 41 minutes. Reece James, on-loan from Manchester United, then scored his first goal for the Terriers straight from a corner. He whipped in an effort from the right in first-half injury time and it went in after Derby keeper Lee Grant came for but missed the ball. Derby came out for the second half on fire and were quickly level when first Simon Dawkins and then Jesse Lingard scored. Substitute Dawkins fired in from a Stephen Warnock cross on 52 minutes while Lingard struck from outside the box after Dawkins initially tried to shoot. Midfielder Lingard, like James, is on loan from Manchester United but unlike the Town man has just signed new a two-year contract at Old Trafford. Huddersfield, pegged back at 3-3, would not give up and were in front again when Wells had a shot deflected in. He had already had a goal ruled on 57 minutes when he followed up with an effort off which looped into the net off a Derby defender after Ishmael Miller was denied. It was end-to-end action and Ince scored his second - again from distance - after good work by Darren Bent to make it 4-4 on 79 minutes. Miller had two goals ruled out, one for a foul on Grant and the other, in stoppage time, for offside. Also in injury time Hudson headed wide from a Jacob Butterfield cross while Johnny Russell nearly had the last word with a free-kick which just went over. A point will help cement Derby's play-off position. Huddersfield, who are already safe, are now unbeaten in five matches.","Derby's Tom Ince scored two long-range goals at Huddersfield in a 4-4 draw .

512,896fe2bda2ed445306c8fd005e8f11288b805eb6,"It is a common fear, known as trypanophobia. For around 20 per cent of the population, the thought of going to the doctors for an injection invokes a deep-rooted sense of dread. Many avoid the doctor's surgery altogether, leaving themselves open to the risk of various illnesses and infections. But for those terrified of needles, a team of scientists at Rice University in Houston, may have the answer. They have developed a new device, Comfortably Numb, to ease the pain of an injection. Their invention numbs the skin prior to the jab by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin. Scroll down for video . Comfortably Numb is a new, single-use device that eases the pain of an injection by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin within 60 seconds . Three first year students, (from L-R) mechanical engineer Mike Hua, bioengineer Andy Zhang and computer scientist Greg Allison, came up with the invention, they describe as 'simple and elegant' The trio, made up of computer scientist Greg Allison, bioengineer Andy Zhang and mechanical engineer Mike Hua, currently has a functioning prototype, that has produced a numbing effect in just 60 seconds. 'Our device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water, ' Mr Hua said. 'A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. 'We then numb the skin by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin.' Current solutions are either ineffective because they fail to numb the skin adequately, or take too long, the researchers said. They noted that a commonly used medicated topical patch takes about an hour to work, whereas their new device 'works on the order of seconds and minutes', Mr Zhang said. 'We are targeting anyone who has to get an injection, which is nearly everyone,' Mr Allison said. 'But the device is especially applicable to people who are more susceptible to pain.' As such, he said, it is particularly useful for children and the elderly. And, it is intended for use during procedures 'where you have to get shots in more sensitive areas of the body, such as the face or the groin', he added. The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. It costs around $2 (£1.34) to produce, they said . The trio said the device could also be used to ease the pain of ear piercings and tattooing, and help reduce swelling. 'We looked into all sorts of methods for numbing, both quick and long-term, chemicals, using ice packs - which is similar to what we're using now,' Mr Hua said. The device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water. A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. The skin can then be numbed by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin. Within 60 seconds the patient's skin is numb and they can have an injection without experiencing pain. 'We explored everything that surrounded the problem before we even began brainstorming.' 'At the end of the day, what we're creating is a self-contained device with a very cold contact surface, and there are many applications for that,' Mr Allison added. Some of the solutions the trio researched were highly technical and required a materials science degree, or skills the first-year students had not yet learned. 'That's the kind of amazing thing about our project,' Mr Allison said. 'Because we don't have these incredibly refined skills in certain areas, that meant we had to think of very simple solutions. 'Being limited in that way led to something that is very novel and innovative, but at the same time, simple and elegant.' The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. Mr Zhang, said: 'The materials that we use are relatively inexpensive and found in abundance: plastic, rubber and metal. The team from Rice University in Houston said the device could be used in future for those having tattoos, or people wanting to get their ears pierced without suffering the pain .

Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment. The Star Tribune reports that the girl's family reported the kidnapping on Sunday and that they opposed to their daughter marrying Xiong, whom she was dating, because of their age differences. Alleged kidnapper: Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St.Paul, Minnesota has been arrested after he allegedly tried to force his 15-year-old girlfriend to be his traditional Hmong bride . Xiong and his parents say they wanted the girl and Xiong to marry in the Hmong tradition. The girl, who has not been identified because she is a minor, told police that Xiong was her 'boyfriend' and that they got into a physical argument over the prospect of marriage on Saturday night. Xiong allegedly threw the girl's iPad against a wall at her family's home and then ripped her sweatpants as he dragged her into his car. Her parents were not home at the time. The girl told police that she managed to escape but that Xiong took hold of her a second time, forced her into his car, and took her to his family's home. When the girl's parents returned home from work at around noon on Sunday, they learned of the kidnapping from their oldest son. The girl's parents called Xiong's parents and demanded that they give them their daughter back. The girl's older brother later drove to the Xiong's home where they willingly let the girl go home. The girl told police that she and Xiong had been 'dating' in January and first had sex when she was just 14-years-old. The victim's father told police that Xiong asked him to marry his daughter on multiple occasions but that he said no because of their large age difference. Xiong admitted to kidnapping the girl and said that she tried to escape from him on Highway 26. This is not Xiong's first brush with the law. In 2009 Xiong was tried in juvenile court or sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl when he was 15. He pleaded guilty. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said about the case, 'This is a very disturbing case involving the victimization of a 15-year-old girl that cannot be tolerated in our community. 'Women and girls are not property, they are human beings who have every right to be free from violence and to live according to how they choose for themselves. 'We allege that the defendant has sexually exploited a minor who cannot legally consent to sex, and has taken violent actions to kidnap and hold the victim against her will.' According to Hmongculture.net, the Hmong are an ethnic group that come from Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. In the late 1980s many Hmong people came to the United States after being sponsored by the Lutheran church. The majority relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota and Fresno, California. In traditional Hmong marriages the man generally asks permission from the girl's family to wed her. If that method fails, there is a tradition of 'bride-napping' in Hmong culture in which the man may literally drag his bride to his house when her parents are not home. If the girl does not accept a gift from her sometimes forceful suitor then she may go back to her family, says Ahmongwoman.com .","Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment .

515,97f4739cb0100524bfa742a5e6e68aa308ca220e,"Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton got her budding presidential campaign's first targeted question about the deadly 2012 Benghazi terror attacks on Tuesday night, and her answer was the sound of one hand clapping. The bash-the-rich candidate flew first class from Boston to Washington, D.C. after wrapping up a two-day New Hampshire campaign trip. Daily Mail Online was on the flight. 'Mrs. Clinton, when are you going to start talking to the press about Benghazi?' Daily Mail Online asked her in the Washington Reagan National Airport terminal. 'Did you make mistakes?' The usually garrulous and broad-smiling Clinton stared straight ahead, continued walking alongside her Secret Service and local police escorts, and said nothing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NO COMMENT: Hillary stared ahead and walked wordlessly Tuesday, refusing to acknowledge her first campaign-trail question about the deadly Benghazi terror attacks in 2012 . DEADLY: The September 11, 2012 Benghazi terror attacks killed four Americans including the US ambassador to Libya . WRONG: Both President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Clinton incorrectly blamed the Benghazi attacks on protests sparked by a YouTube video mocking Islam's prophet Muhammad. The two are shown at a ceremony held to receive the remains of the four Americans who were killed at the scene . Moments earlier, she answered a question about why her taxpayer-funded security detail had sped at 80 MPH past exits for the smaller Manchester, New Hampshire airport, and trekked all the way to Boston for a flight with first class seats. 'You know, I don't make the travel arrangements. I don't,' Clinton said. The Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah's military-style Benghazi attacks will likely be a thorn in Clinton's side throughout the 2016 presidential campaign season. The group laid waste to a State Department facility while she was America's top diplomat. A special congressional committee chaired by South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, has a mandate to investigate the episode through January 2017, making it unlikely that Clinton will be able to put the issue behind her. TROUBLE AHEAD: New Hampshire resident Brian Blackden included 'Benghazi blood' Tuesday on a sign listing reasons 'Hillary is a liar,' near the site of a Clinton appearance at the New Hampshire Technical Institute . On Sunday during a series of 50 brief interviews with Dartmouth College students in Hanover, New Hampshire, 22 of them made references to Bengahzi when asked about Clinton's chances of becoming president. Many of them, like freshman Cameron Poole, weren't old enough to drive when it happened. 'I think there was blood on her hands,' Poole told Daily Mail Online. He said he believes Clinton's performance before, during and after should disqualify her from holding higher office. 'I definitely do,' he said. 'It shows how she acts under pressure.' NOT FORGOTTEN: U.S. Ambassader the Libya Chris Stevens was the first to die in Benghazi, and was seen by Libyans as a moderate – angering anti-American hardliners from radical Islamist groups . CASUALTIES: US Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith (left), US Navy SEAL Glen Doherty (center) and US Nacy SEAL Tyrone Woods (right) perished in the Ansar al-Shariah attacks in Benghazi . Four Americans lost their lives in the September 11, 2012 terror attacks, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, the first American ambassador killed while on duty since 1979. U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith also perished in the initial barrage of mortars and automatic weapons fire. Hours later, a second wave of attacks hit a CIA annex compound nearby, killing CIA contract soldiers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both U.S. Navy SEALs. The four men came home in flag-draped caskets. Congressional Republicans want answers about Clinton's involvement in what they see as a potential cover-up of facts surrounding how the attacks unfolded and why – and how the Obama administration explained it afterward, just weeks before an election. Part of the swirling controversy involves a home-brew email server that Clinton exclusively used for her official electronic communications while she was secretary of state. Clinton never used an official 'state-dot-gov' email address, but told reporters on March 10 that she had given the State Department copes of 'official' emails – and acknowledged deciding herself which ones qualified. She deleted the rest, some 32,000 messages in all. Clinton's attorney has refused to hand over the server to congressional investigators. Gowdy, the Benghazi committee chairman, wants a neutral third-party to examine it and determine if Benghazi-related emails can be recovered. His committee said Wednesday that its report on the Benghazi attacks won't likely be finished until 2016, putting its release squarely in the middle of the presidential campaign's most hotly contested months. But the committee said in a statement that 'Secretary Clinton’s decision to seek the presidency of the United States does not and will not impact the work of the committee.' Clinton's State Department infamously declined to provide her Benghazi outpost with the beefed-up security presence its station chief requested in the weeks preceding the deadly Ansar al-Shariah attacks. She claimed later that she never saw the requests, insisting that such routine diplomatic cables would never have made it to her desk, even if they were addressed to her. FIRST CLASS: Hillary (seated at the front, right) traveled in luxury from Boston to Washington, seated next to chief of staff Huma Abedin, after am 80 MPH Secret Service dash to Logan International Airport . FAREWELL: Hillary Clinton waved at the end of her final campaign stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday, before hitting the road to Boston for the same Washington-bound flight that Daily Mail Online flew on . In the days following the attacks, Clinton said publicly that it was the result of a spontaneous protest over a YouTube video made by an American – a film that insulted the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Such protests were seen in other Muslim countries, but U.S. intelligence determined in real-time that the Benghazi attacks were well-organized and easily traced back to an Islamist terror network. Months later, following a concussion that delayed her congressional testimony about Benghazi, she testified in a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Just days earlier, lawmakers disclosed that a top U.S. diplomat told them 'everyone' at the American diplomatic outpost in Benghazi knew 'from the beginning' that they were in the middle of a terrorist attack. 'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' Clinton told the senators. 'Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans?' 'What difference at this point does it make?'","Former secretary of state landed Tuesday night at Washington Reagan National Airport after a first-class flight from Boston .

Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain. The blonde model had gone on the run but was eventually tracked down to her family's home 2,000 miles away in the small western Slovakian town of Nova Basoca after police put out an international arrest warrant. Scroll down for video . The Slovakian model had gone on the run after Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain . Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found murdered . Now her parents Lubomir Kukuca, 50, and Danka Kukucova, 51, said they feel hated in their own village and are selling up their home to move somewhere more secluded and pay thousands for lawyers' fees in Spain where their daughter is awaiting trial. Gold dealer Mr Bush, 48, from Bristol was found dead in a pool of blood at his five-bed rented home near Estepona just after 3am. His new girlfriend, Russian student Maria Korotaeva, 20, told detectives his Slovakian ex was waiting for them in her pyjamas inside Mr Bush’s mansion when they arrived for a long weekend from the UK. Miss Korotaeva has accused Miss Kukucova of Mr Bush's murder, saying 'She done it. God will be her judge' Maria Korotaeva, 20 (left and right), the most recent girlfriend of murdered millionaire Andrew Bush, 48 (left), has told how the pair arrived at Mr Bush's Spanish villa to find ex-girlfriend Kukucova waiting . She took refuge in Mr Bush’s Hummer while he argued inside with the alleged killer. Miss Korotaeva said Kukucova was ‘crazy’ with jealousy after Mr Bush ended their relationship. She said gunshots rang out before the Slovakian fled the house and forced her out of the car to make her escape. Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested  in Nove Mesto nad Vahom in her home country - more than 2,000 miles from Spain. She was extradited back to Spain in May after handing herself in and locked up in  the maximum security Alhaurin de la Torre jail near Malaga. Maria's parents have visited their daughter and hired lawyers, but their efforts have landed them in debt. Now Kukucova's parents are being forced to sell their home (pictured) in Nova Basoca, western Slovakia, to pay thousands for their daughter's lawyers' fees . Danka Kukucova, 51, (left) Lubomir Kukuca, 50, (right) said said they feel hated in their own village after news of the murder spread and were planning to move to a more secluded area . Her father Lubomir Kukuca, who is seriously ill with cancer, admitted his daughter kept in touch with them while she was on the run. Miss Kukucova’s mother Danka, who supports the family as a manager for a local building society, said at the time of her arrest: ‘We are really struggling. We are upset with what is being said about our daughter.’ Having spent their savings and borrowed money from family, they have decided to sell their home in Nova Bosaca which is on the market for the equivalent of £73,000. One of Maria's cousins, Katarina, who did not want to give her surname, confirmed to the Slovak national newspaper Novy Cas: 'They have decided to leave the house in which they have been living for several years. Mayka Marica Kukucova, pictured after giving herself up to police in her home town of Nova Bosaca in Slovakia . Ms Kukucova had given herself up in her home town which is 3,102km (1,928 miles) from the crime scene in Spain . 'They feel in any case that everybody in the village looks at them as if they are murderers and they no longer feel welcome. People do not ask anything, they just gossip. The parents are fed up with everything. 'The price will not be lower than 100,000 EUR. They will not sell the house for less because they need to return the money that they have borrowed. 'They would also like to buy small secluded house so that they will not be nagged by anybody. 'They are also selling because they hope that Maria will come back and she will want to be in some calm and peaceful place far from people.' Slovak estate agent Lubomir Batovec reckoned the two storey house was not worth more than £59,000 because of the location and its distance from the town of Nove Mesto nad Vahom. He said: 'I am sure that it will not be easy to sell this house - at least not for that money.'

Hamayun Tariq, a divorced 37-year-old who was born and raised in Dudley in the West Midlands, shared four images on Twitter of a room where he claims to make devices known as IEDs. Components are seen organised on shelves and instruction manuals and bomb-making equipment neatly laid out on work surfaces in the room, which the father-of-two says he hopes will emerge as 'the best Electronics LAB in the Islamic state'. Scroll down for video . Well-equipped: British former car mechanic Hamayun Tariq -  who joined the Islamic State as an explosives expert and sniper - has shared chilling images of his new high-tech bomb-making factory in Syria . Boastful: Components are seen organised on shelves in the room, which the father-of-two says he hopes will emerge as 'the best Electronics LAB in the Islamic state' Tariq's social media presence rarely last longer than a few days before being suspended as he specialises in posting detailed instructions on how to build bombs. Despite already doing the same on his latest account, the militant has been able to share images of his bomb-making factory, where he boastfully claims to spend time 'producing sophisticated IEDs'. Terror: Hamayun Tariq is a divorced, 37-year-old father-of-two who was born and raised in Dudley . Tariq - who uses the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani - has methodically arranged the room into areas for building bombs and areas to check their function. He clearly uses expensive equipment, including high-tech microscopes, laptops and radiation testers while building the IEDs and detailed bomb-making manuals are dotted around the factory. After posting photographs of his 'laboratory', the jihadi wrote on Twitter: 'IEDs is my favourite weapon after Sniping, u hit the enemy & disappear in thin air just like a Ghost. Its a Must'. Tariq served a sentence for fraud in the UK before joining ISIS in Syria late last year. Shortly after joining the terrorist group he began posting detailed explosive-making instructions and encouraging 'lone wolves' still living in the West to carry out deadly bomb attacks. Tariq has previously posted under various Twitter handles but he is usually suspended rarely quickly thanks to bomb-making guides and sickening calls for terror attacks in the UK. He regularly posted photographs of handwritten instructions explaining how to assemble crude explosive devices and listing the chemicals needed to create deadly poisons. Chilling: Hamayun Tariq - who uses the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani - has methodically arranged the room into areas for building bombs and areas to check their functionality . Sick: Tariq served a sentence for fraud in the UK before joining ISIS in Syria last year. He soon began posting detailed explosive-making instructions and encouraging 'lone wolves' to carry out deadly bomb attacks . ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source. The source said that he was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition while travelling in a three-car convoy in March in Nineveh, Iraq. At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian . Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren’t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. Tariq's Twitter rants appear to have been in retaliation for him allegedly having his British passport revoked in 2013. One of his most widely shared messages was a sarcastic note of 'thanks' to Home Secretary Theresa May for 'revoking my British citizenship'. Alongside the message was page after page of bomb-making material from a 2006 terrorist manual named the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook. Tariq previously claimed to have encountered up to 40 other British nationals in his first seven weeks as an ISIS fighter in Syria, according to the Guardian, who spoke to him via Twitter's private messaging function on a now disabled account. Describing himself as 'really happy' to have joined the terror group, he reportedly added that he had also met a 'fixer' who was smuggling 1,000 new recruits into ISIS-held areas of Syria every week. He reportedly told the newspaper that he first embraced radical Islam in 2000. Tariq was arrested for fraud in Wolverhampton in 2005 but fled to Pakistan to avoid the case going to trial. He was deported back to Britain two years later and served three and a half years in prison. He claims to have left Britain immediately after his release in 2012 and moved to the Waziristan region of north west Pakistan, where he joined the local Taliban branch. Expensive: Hamayun Tariq clearly uses expensive equipment, including high-tech microscopes, laptops and radiation testers while building the IEDs and detailed bomb-making manuals are dotted around the factory . One of Tariq's most widely shared messages was this sarcastic note of 'thanks' to Home Secretary Theresa May for 'revoking my British citizenship'. Alongside the message posted on this long-disabled account was a copy of bomb-making material from a 2006 terrorist manual named the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook . In September or early October Tariq is understood to have been contacted by ISIS fixers who paid for his transport to join the terror group in Syria. He was trained as a sniper before moving on to specialise in explosives - a subject he has been interested in since studying for a GCSE in Science in the mid-1990s. Tariq described his new life under ISIS as far more comfortable than that in Pakistan. 'Life was tough in Waziristan but here I can't believe I get a salary, I get rent. They even paid for my transport. I'm really happy here and all the guys I've met from the UK are also happy and settled,' he was quoted as saying. The Home Office would not speak about Tariq's claim that his passport had been cancelled, saying they could not comment on individual cases. However they did add that in a broader sense any individual who has conducted himself 'in a manner seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK' can have their citizenship revoked. The Home Office has said there are at least 500 Britons fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq, although a number of experts believe the real figure is likely to greatly exceed that.","Hamayun Tariq, 37, shared four images of the factory on his Twitter page .

Karren Brady, vice-chairman of West Ham, announced during the week that the club would be making significant cuts to their current pricing as the move is being offset against increased television revenue. The cheapest season ticket at Upton Park is £620 but there will be £289 seats on offer from the 2016-17 season - the club's first in the 54,000-seater Olympic Stadium. West Ham's season tickets will cost as little as £289 when the club move to the Olympic Stadium next year .

And Allardyce believes performing in front of a sold-out crowd is something that should not go unappreciated as the other 19 Premier League clubs are now being pushed to follow West Ham's lead. 'The most important thing at a football club is to fill the stadium,' he said. 'I think filling the stadium is the ultimate for the success of the team.

520,9b5117ce299e1ae21141809563adcfb5308a0c97,"Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered £20 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.'

521,f06f476e152afb0377bf251c898e6a3310f080bb,"David Luiz should not play in central defence again after his horror show in PSG's 3-1 defeat against Barcelona, according to former England boss Glenn Hoddle. The ex-Chelsea defender came off the bench in Wednesday night's Champions League quarter-final first leg and was nutmegged twice by Luis Suarez in the build-up to the Uruguayan's two goals. Luiz suffered a hamstring injury 10 days ago but Hoddle, who insists that the Brazilian has always been a defensive liability, believes he still showed his naivety even if he wasn't fully fit. Luis Suarez puts the ball through David Luiz's legs on his way to scoring his second goal of the night . Luiz suffered the same fate when Suarez weaved his way into the box for Barcelona's second goal . The Brazilian was left with his head in his hands after allowing Suarez a clean run at goal . Asked about Luiz's defending for Barcelona's third goal, the Sky Sports pundit said: 'Even if you're not 100 per cent fit you can't show that lack of intent. 'He's the last man on the pitch when Suarez picks the ball up and starts running at him. He realises he's the last man and the very last thing (you should do) when you're last man is jump in. You bide time for your team to get around you. 'He does what an eight year old who hasn't been coached does. He tries to win it by putting both of his feet together but when he does that he can't move anywhere. Suarez nutmegs him again.' Some of Luiz's best performances for PSG - and former club Chelsea - came when he was deployed in a central midfield role with less defensive responsibility, something Hoddle believes manager Laurent Blanc should consider from now on. Sky Sports pundit Glenn Hoddle described Luiz as a 'liability at the back' after PSG's defeat . Luiz defended like an 'eight-year-old who hasn't been coached' in this challenge, according to Hoddle . Suarez tucks home the first of his two goals against PSG after nutmegging Luiz with ease . He added: 'For me he's a liability at the back. He always has been. You have to find a place (for him) in midfield or even at right back. 'He's a footballer who likes to play in the playground when there's no shape to the game. He's a talent but that's not what top football is about.' However Hoddle's fellow pundit, former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, was quick to point the blame in the direction of Blanc, who chose to introduce the 25-year-old after an injury to Thiago Silva. Henry said: 'If David Luiz wasn't fit enough to start the game, why does he come on as a sub after 21 minutes? Luiz looks dejected after contributing to his side's 3-1 defeat in their Champions League quarter-final first leg . Jamie Redknapp also admitted that Luiz can be a liability but Thierry Henry questioned the player's fitness . 'From a coaching point of view, why would you put him in? If he's not fit enough to start, why do you put him in?' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp, who was also in the Sky Sports studio, showed some sympathy for Luiz but pointed towards the sheer number of high-profile errors made by the former Benfica man in recent seasons. Responding to Henry, Redknapp said: 'I do agree with you but I've seen him do that every single week in the Premier League. 'That's one of the reasons Chelsea were quick to get rid of him. Defensively, at times, he's a liability.'","David Luiz was at fault for both of Luis Suarez's goals in Barcelona's win .

Murphy, player of the month for February and March, went over in the left corner on 15 minutes from Jake Connor's pass. He was then on hand when Ukuma Ta'ai, who also scored twice, caught and off-loaded a kick from Danny Brough on 37 minutes. In-form winger Aaron Murphy scored twice in a seven-try romp as Huddersfield beat Catalans Dragons . Former Wakefield Wildcats star Murphy, 27, has now scored six tries in his last five appearances. Having fallen behind Catalans hit back to lead 8-6 - with scrum-half Scott Dureau bagging all of their points. He scored a try on 21 minutes when Elliot Whitehead passed inside after a solo dash past two players split the Giants defence. Dureau converted and then added a penalty goal on 24 minutes for a poor shoulder charge on him by Joe Wardle. Wardle was restored to the Giants line-up after being suspended for last week's defeat by St Helens for a dangerous throw on Ben Cockayne. Huddersfield responded with three tries in 10 minutes at the end of the first half - and it could have been more. Connor nearly put Murphy in again down the left on 27 minutes while Leroy Cudjoe was held up on the right flank after Brough's break from deep. In between Ta'ai pounced for a try when a Dragons defender fumbled a high kick from Brough on 30 minutes. Scotland star Brough, whose kicking caused problems for the visitors all game, was at it twice more before half-time. His kick led to Murphy's second try and then another Brough bomb was dropped on the hooter by a defender and Cudjoe pounced. Brough, who took his tally to 58 points for the season with three earlier conversions, this time hit the post. Huddersfield led 22-8 at the break, with the sides trading tries after the restart as Catalans narrowed the gap to 26-14. Julian Bousquet scored a converted try on 45 minutes while Jermaine McGillvary went over at the other end eight minutes later. There was controversy on 62 minutes when a simmering feud between Cudjoe and Willie Tong boiled over. The pair seemed to exchange words and former NRL star Tong responded by appearing to headbutt Cudjoe right in front of referee Robert Hicks. Tong was sin-binned and Cudjoe got a verbal warning in the presence of Giants skipper Brough. Huddersfield took full advantage of the extra man by running in two quick tries, first from Ta'ai a minute later and then Scott Grix on 65 minutes. There was no further score, but Louis Anderson lost his temper late on as Huddersfield defensively shut the game down.","Aaron Murphy scored twice as Huddersfield ended three-match losing run .

The 25-year-old suspect, who has been identified as Gul Ahmad Saeed, is alleged to have shot dead his fiancee, her parents and seven of her siblings on Sunday, police have said. Their deaths came just months after he is alleged to have killed his own parents, brother and sister-in-law after they objected to the match. Frustrated: Gul Ahmad Saeed is alleged to have gone on a killing spree after becoming angry with people obstructing his wedding plans. Pictured: Stock image of Pakistani brides and grooms at a mass wedding . Saeed has been on the run ever since, but returned to his home town in town in north-west Pakistan at the weekend - at which point he is suspected of killing his fiancee's family with the help of accomplices. He is said to have been outraged over her uncle's dithering over the marriage. 'The uncle was being very indecisive about the wedding which infuriated Gul Ahmad,' said police officer Mohammad Jamil. Police were searching for the suspects but they were believed to have fled into the semi-autonomous Pashtun tribal area along the Afghan border, where government authorities hold little sway and police are not legally permitted to go. 'We cannot follow anyone there since it is beyond our jurisdiction, and our security would be threatened,' said Jamil. Fled: Saeed, 25, is now said to be in the semi-autonomous Pashtun area, on the border with Afghanistan . The killings took place in a deeply conservative area where women there are often discouraged from going to school and have little choice when it comes to marriage. Pakistani women are often killed by men who feel their honour has been offended in some way. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that 869 women were murdered in so-called honour killings in 2013, the last year for which data is available.","Gul Ahmad Saeed suspected of shooting fiancee, her parents and siblings .

524,023a4ebed179d1962e683673b90c06e68425660f,"Concerns are growing over Russian ships that have docked in a once-secret  naval base in the Arctic. Military leaders in Norway are nervous about its powerful neighbour's presence on its 'strategically important' coastline following a spike in tensions between Russia and NATO nations. Some experts have criticised the shutting down of Olavsvern Naval Base - a huge complex buried in mountainous terrain near the town of Tromsoe - which has been closed since 2009. But fears have once again peaked after three Russian ships spent the entire winter docked deep within the mountain hideaway which was once a heavily guarded military facility. Show of strength: Norway's military leaders are growing concerned after three Russian warships spent the winter docked inside a closed naval base (file photo) deep inside the country's mountainous terrain . Aggression: In February, RAF planes intercepted two Russian bombers (file photo) which had flown into Irish territory and forced a passenger jet to divert its course . Force: And late last year, the Russian navy anti-submarine ship Severomorsk (file photo) and three other Russian ships had to be escorted out of the British channel . It was originally shut because the country's leaders thought the threat from Moscow was reduced, despite its massive Northern Fleet which is base in the nearby Kola Peninsula. Norway's former vice admiral said shutting down the base was 'pure madness' while other critics say their submarines now have to travel hundreds of extra miles to protect the region. This is far from the first time Russia has flexed its military muscles in other countries' territory. In February, a passenger plane had to be diverted to avoid two Russian bombers that flew through Irish-controlled airspace without warning. The disruption on February 18 was thought to have occurred during the same incident in which British RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to escort the Russian vessels. That move was perceived as a show of strength by Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine conflict after Prime Minister David Cameron accused him of challenging the 'territorial integrity' of Kiev. It followed a separate incident when the Royal Navy had to intercept a Russian warship which strayed to close to the UK while passing through the English channel the same month. The Neustrashimy-class warship – equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes – was monitored and escorted by a heavily-armed British frigate. Cat and mouse: Heavily-armed HMS Argyll follows the Russian warship (back left) as it passes through the English Channel in February . Intercepted: Footage released on Russian TV showed the moment two RAF jets escorted the Russian bomber in February . Concerned: They are worried by this perceived show of strength from Moscow (Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured) and its presence on its 'strategically important' coastline . And late last year, the HMS Tyne had to escort another Russian destroyer and three other boats from the Channel as they passed through the Strait of Dover after carrying out military exercises in the North Sea. Since January 2014, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: . Feb 18: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall, forcing a flight from Dublin to divert. Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel. Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth. Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland. Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne. Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland. Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain. Elinar Skorgen added: 'We are the only country along with Russia to have a permanent presence in the Barents Sea, where we share a common border. Obviously our navy should be stationed there, including our submarines. If the ships aren't there where they are needed, they might as well be scrapped altogether.' The Armed forces put the base - which cost over £390million to construct - up for sale on Norway's version of eBay. It was eventually bought for just £3.5million by a Norwegian businessmen and was rented out to Russian research vessels which were reportedly linked to the country's state-owned energy giant Gazprom. Its landlord Gunnar Wilhelmsen said: 'There are no longer any secrets surrounding this base... Not since the military and NATO agreed to put it on sale over the Internet, along with photographs of every nook and cranny.' Many military experts are now worried by the the potential for Russian military activity aboard the research vessels. A former second in command for the Norwegian military said: 'Russia is a country where the state has a say over all commercial or semi-state business. It's clear, very few people know what happens on these vessels.' Jan Reksten believes the sale of Olavsvern was 'a double loss' as 'Norway's armed forces lost an important base and now there are Russian vessels docked there'.","Three Russian ships that docked in Olavsvern Naval Base for the entire winter .

Mourinho said Sunday's game at the Emirates was the best Terry had ever played. That was a pat on the back for his captain but also justification for Mourinho’s faith in playing him. Terry is in a real purple patch and his reading of the game is better than ever. Part of his success comes from the way the team is set up in front of him. All of their good work means he is in prime position each time to make the telling tackle or interception. John Terry (left) was in inspiring form in the Chelsea defence as his side kept a clean sheet against Arsenal . Sportsmail's Martin Keown says the Blues skipper is enjoying some of the best football of his career . The 34-year-old defender's timing in the tackle has been impeccable for the majority this season . His decision-making is excellent and he waits for the perfect moment to get involved — there can be an element of gambling with that but it is a calculated risk. He was always able to anticipate where Arsenal wanted to play the game and stop them from doing it. As Chelsea have become harder to beat, Terry has come into his own. Following an entertaining first half, Arsenal's tempo appeared to drop after the half time break . GHOSTS OF MONACO? In the first half Arsenal played at a terrific tempo, especially down the left, but the whistle came at the perfect time for Chelsea. After the break Arsenal didn’t move the ball quickly enough. They looked mindful of the Monaco game where they lost control but here there was not enough spark. Gunners striker Olivier Giroud had a frustrating afternoon against a rugged Chelsea defence . Danny Welbeck's pace through the middle could have instead caused the Chelsea back line a lot trouble . A MISSED OPPORTUNITY . I’m a big fan of Olivier Giroud but Arsenal needed to ask a different question of the Chelsea defence. John Terry and Gary Cahill are built to deal with players like Giroud and everything was played in front of them. If Danny Welbeck had played through the middle, his pace could have unsettled Chelsea. It’s much easier to be compact when there’s no threat in behind. The Arsenal supporters were heard lamenting Chelsea's 'boring' performance at the Emirates Stadium . Despite many questioning Chelsea's tactics in the big games Jose Mourinho's team are in full control . JOSE IS ALWAYS THE BOSS . The Arsenal fans said it was boring but Chelsea are doing what they need to do to see out a championship. There is no problem with that. If anything that element of control is something Arsenal would do well to copy. Yes, there was no striker but could Didier Drogba really play three games in a row at 37? Jose just made good use of his squad. At the start of the season Chelsea played with so much expression it looked like the players were in charge. Now they look dogged, disciplined and firmly in control. There is no doubt as to who is the boss now.","Martin Keown: Danny Welbeck's pace might have unsettled Chelsea .

'Arsenal need to buy four players, they need that spine,' the Frenchman told Sky Sports. 'They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I’m afraid, they need a top, top-quality striker in order to win this league again.' Here, Sportsmail’s Simon Jones analyses the possible options for Arsenal in key positions. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will be looking to add to his squad ahead of the 2015-16 Premier League season . GOALKEEPERS . PETR CECH . Chelsea . Cost: £10million . Jose Mourinho says it will cost 'huge money' for Cech who at 32 is still reliable and a calming influence. Paris Saint-Germain remain the front-runners for his signature although Liverpool maintain hope too. The figures and Cech's age would normally act as a deterrent for the cash-conscious Arsene Wenger. However, Cech's experience could settle an often nervy defence and lift the performance levels of those around him. Petr Cech looks set to leave Chelsea after losing his No 1 spot to Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois . BERND LENO . Bayer Leverkusen . Cost: £12million . Arsenal have a keen interest in the 23-year-old German Under 21 international. He already has good experience having made his Champions League debut against Chelsea in 2011 at 19. Arsenal scouts watching his team-mate Lars Bender have been impressed and Leno is interested in a move. His contract runs to 2018 but he said: 'The foreign option is certainly appealing. A new language, a new culture - that I could definitely imagine.' Bernd Leno pulls off a brilliant save during Bayer Leverkusen's 1-1 Bundesliga draw against Cologne . MATTIA PERIN . Genoa . Cost: £16million . Arsenal have pondered the experience of Real Madrid's Iker Casillas, the promise of Mainz's Loris Karius but Mattia Perin at Genoa keeps cropping up on their scouting lists. He is 22 and tipped to become the new Gianluigi Buffon but Arsenal have watched him for three years now. Liverpool have also considered him as have Inter Milan. Another option with Premier League experience and at a similar price who has been discussed is Asmir Begovic of Stoke City. Arsenal have been scouting 22-year-old Genoa goalkeeper Mattia Perin for the past three years . DEFENDERS . ALEKSANDAR DRAGOVIC . Dinamo Kiev . Cost: £12million . Dragovic has been watched several times by Arsenal scouts. The Austria international is the subject of interest from Inter Milan and they are keen to strike a deal at the end of the season. Manchester United and West Ham have also watched Dragovic after first being alerted when he played for Basle alongside Fabian Schar. Arsenal though remain unsure Dragovic is for them. The Gunners have been keeping track of Aleksandar Dragovic but the Austrian is a target for Inter Milan . AYMEN ABDENNOUR . Monaco . Cost: £10million . The 25-year-old Tunisia international has not long extended his contract until 2019 but would like to join Arsenal who have had scouts posted at most Monaco games throughout the season. They are well aware of Abdennour, who has over 30 international caps and has progressed from his time at Toulouse. He is left-sided, has good pace and can pass well. He also had the measure of Olivier Giroud at the Emirates in February. Newcastle and Tottenham have checked on him also. Aymen Abdennour has not long extended his Monaco deal until 2019 but would like to join Arsenal . HECTOR MORENO . Espanyol . Cost: £8million . Arsenal scout Brian McDermott checked on Moreno last January as the Mexico international made his return to fitness from a broken leg he suffered last summer. They have maintained their interest in the 27-year-old who is highly rated by former coach Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham. He is up for sale as Espanyol look to raise funds and has made 23 appearances since December. He was sent off in the derby against Barcelona at the weekend and could prove a cheaper back-up option. Hector Moreno (left) could be leaving Espanyol as the Spanish club look to raise funds this summer . DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDERS . GEOFFREY KONDOGBIA . Monaco . Cost: £20million . Arsenal are back on the trail of Kondogbia after he impressed against them in the Champions League. Liverpool have also watched the 22-year-old Frenchman but Wenger and Champions League football will strengthen Arsenal's hand if they choose to step up interest. Much depends how Francis Coquelin performs between now and the end of the season but Kondogbia is a player of great potential. Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia would give Arsene Wenger an alternative to Francis Coquelin . MORGAN SCHNEIDERLIN . Southampton . Cost: £30million . Like Lars Bender of Bayer Leverkusen and Moussa Sissoko at Newcastle, Schneiderlin is a player who has been long admired by Wenger. He is expected to be the subject of an early summer bid from Arsenal. Southampton want him to stay but have already earmarked players to replace him should he go. Tottenham, Manchester United and Liverpool have also looked at the 25-year-old France international, who is one of the league's best midfielders. Morgan Schneiderlin (centre) has long been admired by Wenger and looks set to leave Southampton . JAMES McCARTHY . Everton . Cost: £30million . Everton do not wish to sell but McCarthy is a player Arsenal like a lot. Tottenham's head of recruitment Paul Mitchell also has the Republic of Ireland international high on his wishlist and the north London neighbours will test Everton's resolve as they formalise summer plans. McCarthy is still only 24 but has plenty of experience. Highly regarded by his team-mates and coaches alike, he can also play a more advanced role if required. James McCarthy celebrates scoring Everton's opening goal against Manchester United on Sunday . CENTRE FORWARDS . MARIO MANDZUKIC . Atletico Madrid . Cost: £20million . Aggressive, skilful and a goalscorer. Mandzukic is a handful on and off the pitch but he would give Arsenal an edge they lack. He fell out with Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich and his relationship with Diego Simeone has been strained. His representatives have already sounded out Premier League clubs and he seems intent on a move to England. Wenger wanted him last summer but the Croat was keen to replace Diego Costa at Atletico. Mario Mandzukic seems intent on a move to England and Wenger wanted the striker last summer . ALEXANDRE LACAZETTE . Lyon . Cost: £25million . Cash-strapped Lyon are doing their best to hike up the price of their star striker and he seems intent on leaving with Manchester City and Liverpool also among clubs to have checked on him this season. He has 28 goals in 32 games, breaking club records, but has struggled against the top sides. Still only 23, Lacazette can play off either wing and act as a foil to a big target man. Fits Arsenal's style and life with Wenger would be a big pull for the ambitious Frenchman. Alexandre Lacazette (right) has scored 28 goals in 32 games for Lyon so far this season . EDINSON CAVANI . Paris Saint-Germain . Cost: £35million . Cavani has been looking for a move away from Paris for the past year and Juventus are very keen. His representatives held talks with Manchester United last year and he was ready to join prior to David Moyes departing. PSG do not wish to sell though and Arsenal have been considering other options such as Napoli's Gonzalo Higuain, Mattia Destro at Roma and Palermo's Paulo Dybala, but he is keen to stay in Italy. Edinson Cavani has been looking for a move away from Paris and has been linked to Arsenal .","Thierry Henry wants Arsenal to sign a 'spine' of top players .

Argentine Jorge Lopez was killed in a suspicious road accident while in Sao Paulo in July. Guardiola was sporting the top - which read ‘#JusticiaParaTopo’ - during his pre-match press conference before Bayern Munich emphatically dumped Porto out of the Champions League. The message appeared to support a campaign to investigate Lopez’s death. UEFA have charged Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola after he wore this t-shirt in a press conference . Guardiola wore the top demanding justice for Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez who died in a car crash at the World Cup . UEFA say Guardiola has been disciplined because of an ‘incident of a non-sporting nature’ Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez was killed when a taxi he was travelling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car . Lopez was killed when a taxi he was traveling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car being chased by police. UEFA revealed that the Spanish manager had been disciplined because of an ‘incident of a non-sporting nature’, in a move likely to cause public outcry. The European governing body’s disciplinary regulations read: ‘A breach of these principles is committed by anyone who uses sporting events for manifestations of a non-sporting nature.’ They are to review the case on May 21. On wearing the shirt, Guardiola said: ‘Last week, the family has given me the T-shirt. I woke up this morning and knew that I would put it.’ Lopez was a highly regarded journalist in South America and his passing drew huge outpouring from the very top of the game. Last year Atletico Madrid boss and former Argentina midfielder Diego Simeone tweeted that Lopez was ‘not only a great journalist’ but ‘also a friend’ after hearing of the news. Lionel Messi dedicated Argentina's World Cup semi-final win to the 38-year-old, who died in Sao Paolo . FIFA, Diego Simeone and Javier Mascherano have also paid tribute to Lopez (pictured with Alfredo de Stefano) Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez was working for La Red Radio at the World Cup in Brazil, as well as Ole and Spanish publications AS and Sport. Married to Marca's Argentina correspondent, Veronica Brunatti, López was well connected in Spain, where he arrived to follow the career of Javier Saviola in 2001. Saviola and Topo Lopez remained close friends and he was Ole's correspondent in Barcelona, a newspaper he had worked with since its launch. He had worked as a journalist for two decades, covering River Plate and Argentina for Ole while collaborating with Spanish daily Sport while spending time back in Buenos Aires. In 2010 he became AS's correspondent in Argentina was the journalist closest to Lionel Messi and the many of his team-mates. Lionel Messi also dedicated Argentina’s World Cup semi-final win to the 38-year-old. ‘Big hug to all the Argentina fans and a very special memory for Jorge “Topo” Lopez,' wrote Messi after their penalties victory against Germany. 'This victory is especially for you, my friend. A big hug to the family, lots of strength.' Earlier this month Javier Mascherano devoted the launch of his new book to Lopez, while he and Messi were both pictured holding placards with the message on late last year. So too did legend Diego Maradona. Both Barcelona and Atletico Madrid have posed in front of a board during team photographs.

529,c4212c1cd1ee2a9f032943ca448e2ce69eb0db29,"Cleared: 53-year-old Graeme Finlay, a former naval serviceman . A cruise ship passenger was yesterday cleared of beating up two elderly holidaymakers in a row over rudeness at the dinner table. Graeme Finlay, 53, went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner. After being cleared Finlay, an ex-naval serviceman from Glasgow, said: 'It's been hell. It's put me off boats forever.' The frail couple accused Finlay of an unprovoked attack that left the grandfather with a gash to his forehead and his wife with two fractured vertebrae. But the 16-stone gas worker insisted he only acted in self-defence when hit by Mr Phillips wielding his crutch and denied attacking his wife. The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm. He told how he had put on five-stone by comfort eating since his arrest more than a year ago, and added: 'I'm really delighted with the verdicts and very, very relieved.' He said: 'It's been very stressful for the last year and a half. I go to church and I'm on the golf club committee, and it's been awful seeing my face in the news. 'I'm very sorry about everything that happened that night, I really am, but I told the truth in the court and I'm thankful that the jury believed me.' In his evidence, the defendant recalled how he was travelling alone on the Canary Islands cruise in January last year and felt shunned when he joined two couples – including Mr and Mrs Phillips – for dinner in the restaurant. After looking at the menu there was an 'awkward' silence and he moved to another table with a couple he had previously met. Both Finlay and the elderly couple spent the evening drinking separately and enjoying the musical entertainment. According to Finlay they later found themselves in a lift together and he rebuked the couple for their rudeness towards him at dinner. Finlay claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of hot chocolate at him, swore and struck him with his crutch. He told the court: 'I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself, I covered my face with my arms, I didn't want my eye poked out.'

The 'victims' insisted they had not argued with Finlay or ignored him at dinner and were subjected to a vicious assault as they headed to bed following a relaxing evening. Mrs Phillips briefly lost consciousness when she fell against a wall. In her evidence, she said: 'I saw Ron lying on the bulkhead and this great big guy going boof, boof, boof (she swung a punching motion). 'He must have hit him five times. I put my hand on his arm and told him 'leave him alone you will kill him.' Finlay was later forced to leave the ship and make his own way home. He was interviewed by police and charged.","Elderly couple accused Graeme Finlay of knocking them unconscious on boat .

Liam Dawe, 21, was born a healthy child but suffered serious and on-going health complications ever since he was assaulted as a four week old. He died at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon in March last year from 'intra-abdominal sepsis' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault. Liam Dawe died at Derriford Hospital (pictured) in Plymouth, Devon, in March last year from 'intra-abdominal sepsis' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault . At an inquest into his death in Plymouth, coroner Ian Arrow said: 'On the balance of probability, Mr Dawe's health was compromised (by the assault) and he died earlier than expected.' A senior officer attended the hearing and said the law changed in 1996 that meant an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if it happened more than a year before. But Det Con Insp David Elliott said as Mr Dawe's injuries were caused in 1993 before the rules came into force, fresh manslaughter charges could still be brought. The inquest heard that Liam, of Tavistock, Devon, was born an otherwise 'normal, healthy baby with no concerns' in 1993, but was shaken at just four weeks old. Police are considering manslaughter charges after Liam Dawe died two decades after being assaulted as a four week old . As a result of an injury to the brain, Mr Dawe developed severe cerebral palsy, epilepsy and visual impairment as well as learning, feeding and respiratory difficulties. He was admitted to Derriford Hospital on March 4 of last year with jaundice and later died on March 25 after his condition deteriorated following a laparotomy to treat an intra-abdominal sepsis. His GP Dr Jo Coldron said: 'There was no health concern at birth, but at four-weeks-old, Liam suffered from a non-accidental injury that led to learning difficulties, cerebral palsy muscle spasms, scoliosis, epilepsy, an unprotected airway and respiratory difficulties. 'On March 4, Liam was admitted to Derriford Hospital. He was slightly jaundiced but otherwise seemed well. 'He was later admitted to ICU, but there was no clear source for his abdominal sepsis. The 'year and a day rule' stated that an act was presumed not to have caused a person to die if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death. The ancient rule, which applied to death and suicide, was abolished under the Law Reform Act 1996 amid medical advances. However, the permission of the Attorney General is still required for any prosecution where it is claimed that the death occurred more than three years after the act, or when the offender has previously been convicted of an offence in connection with the death. 'On March 12, he was discharged by ICU onto the ward where his condition deteriorated before he died on March 25.' DCI Elliott attended the inquest to assess the assault Mr Dawe sustained as a baby to determine its significance in his death. He said: 'The question asked of us was if somebody would be prosecuted for manslaughter. 'The adult who assaulted Liam when he was four weeks old was convicted and sent to prison for 12 months imprisonment. 'Liam was shaken at four weeks old and his injuries resulted in ongoing health problems. 'The assault was a deliberate act and, at the time, the question was whether the adult intended to cause grievous bodily harm. 'In June 1996, there was a law change to the ""Year and a Day"" rule which stated an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death. 'However, as the injuries were sustained in January 1993, the rule still stands.' Coroner Ian Arrow concluded the cause of Liam's death was 'intra-abdominal sepsis in an individual with severe cerebral palsy.'","Liam Dawe was born healthy but suffered on-going health complications .

531,77c40bba42532d317cabac0f98441a202367b754,"A teenager who fell ill with flu four months ago is unable to move her arms and legs and can barely eat or talk. Doctors are still trying to find out what the future holds for 17-year-old Natasha Willard after she was diagnosed with inflammation of the brain when she fell ill while studying for her A-levels in Cwmbran in Wales. Miss Willard's family are unsure how the teenager became ill so suddenly, just four days after she returned her feeling unwell. They are now trying to teach her to walk and talk again. Natasha Willard was studying for her A levels at college when she appeared to get the flu just before Christmas and her condition has worsened, leaving her unable to move her limbs and barely able to speak . Her stepmother Kirsty Willard said: 'The doctors are baffled, they do not know what happened. 'They have given her antibiotics and she is on steroids too. 'We are just left in limbo. The doctors have not said what the future holds; they cannot give us that information.' Natasha has been diagnosed with encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. Natasha appeared fit and well days before she came home ill, and appeared to quickly go down hill . Mrs Willard said doctors have told them they are unsure whether she will make progress, but have warned the family she is unlikely to fully return to herself. Natasha, from Cwmbran, was studying art and Welsh in the sixth form at Torfaen's Llantarnam School when she fell ill. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Symptoms include seizures, convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, haemorrhaging, and memory loss. Encephalitis develops in reaction to a viral infection or when the body's own immune system attacks brain tissue. The condition can also be caused by the immune system reacting to a tumour. Around 4,000 people are diagnosed with encephalitis every year. Some people make a full recovery from the condition but others can be left with permanent damage to the brain and complications including memory loss and epilepsy. She came home on December 5 after a night out with friends and went straight to bed. Over the next few days Miss Willard started vomiting and had aches and pains, and her family presumed she had the flu. But on December 9 she collapsed and was mumbling and had to be taken to hospital. The teenager cannot remember the first four weeks of her illness and  was unresponsive for the first three. She was then transferred from University of Wales Hospital, Cardiff, to Rookwood Hospital, also in Cardiff, for intensive physiotherapy and speech therapy. 'She can say a few words,' said Mrs Willard. 'She can say ""Hi dad"" and ""Hi Kirsty."" She can say her own name, and her brothers' names, her sister's name and she can say ""yeah.""' Mrs Willard said they are having to teach the 17-year-old everything from scratch, as if she is a child again. But, she adds that she has not complained about her condition. Mrs Willard, who works in a bar, said they are worried about the reaction of people when the teenager is discharged from hospital. 'I would hate to think her friends would see her in a wheelchair and abandon her,' she said . Miss Willard (left) is pictured before her prom in 2014 and with her father Robert (right) before she became ill . Miss Willard's family have been told by doctors that they do not know if she will make a full recovery . November will be the teenager's 18th birthday and her family are hoping she will be able to come home. The family have been raising funds to pay for their hospital visits and have collected £700 packing bags in Cwmbran's Asda. 'We rely on lifts and buses,' Kirsty said. 'We don't want to put too much on our families. When we take the kids it costs £17.10. 'Without the kids it is still £8 each.'","Natasha Willard appeared to be suffering from flu just before Christmas .

533,b3a44de0ebdd20e9d00adbca83b3bd495bc46dca,"Eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements, a study has claimed. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.","University of Montana student studied recoveries after a workout .

534,4886c90f0743e9044a6cf7716f59179b7d7c7e72,"Miami (CNN)World heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has an important title defense coming up, but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in Ukraine. Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. ""My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,"" Klitschko told CNN. ""I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting."" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. ""People are dying in Ukraine every single day,"" Klitschko said. ""I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen."" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. ""I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,"" he said. ""Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want. ""If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom. ""We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship."" Klitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can. ""As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family."" The 39-year-old and his fiancée Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya. ""I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,"" he said. Klitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. ""I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue."" But after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring. ""I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ... I hope in peace we can do anything, but if we have war then it's definitely going to leave us dull and numb."" Watch Wladimir Klitschko's Human to Hero interview on CNN's World Sport program on Wednesday April 8 at 1130, 1245, 1445, 2130, 2245 and 2345 and Thursday April 9 at 0445 (All times GMT) and here online.","Reigning world heavyweight champion discusses Ukraine crisis .

The number of GPs from abroad is up by 11 per cent in a decade as the NHS tries to combat a shortage of staff. Foreigners now account for almost one family doctor in five although in some areas the proportion is more than two-thirds. Senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the NHS is so short of homegrown medics. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that 22.0 per cent of current GPs gained their qualifications overseas, up from 19.8 per cent in 2004 . But the figure is 71 per cent in Barking and Dagenham, east London, 63 per cent in Medway, Kent, and 58 per cent in North Lincolnshire. The NHS is facing a shortage because many GPs are retiring early. Others are moving overseas in search of better conditions. The Royal College of GPs estimates that the NHS will need to hire at least 8,000 more doctors over the next five years to keep pace with a rising, and ageing, population. The NHS employs 40,584 GPs, of whom 8,941 are from overseas. This is up from 6,921 in 2004 when there were 34,855 family doctors in total. Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘We need GPs from around the world to support the Health Service, and we simply don’t train enough. ‘We need to encourage more students and junior doctors to choose general practice, and to expose them more to general practice, so they see it more as an attractive option for the future.’ The figures do not state where the foreign GPs trained but separate data from the General Medical Council shows many are from India, Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria. Earlier this year UKIP leader Nigel Farage sparked controversy by claiming that foreign GPs should not be working on the NHS as they didn’t speak good enough English . Earlier this year Ukip leader Nigel Farage sparked controversy by claiming that foreign GPs should not work for the NHS because they lack good English. He said: ‘Don’t we want to live in a country where we speak the same language? And isn’t it scandalous that we are not training enough nurses and doctors in our own country?’ Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘The NHS – general practice included – is staffed by hardworking healthcare professionals from all over the world. 'We are very grateful for the work that doctors from overseas are doing.’ The NHS should train more staff rather than spending £2.5 billion a year on locum doctors and agency nurses, a think-tank has suggested. A larger pool of dependable permanent staff would also enhance workforce stability and patient safety, the cross-party Civitas said. The subsequent increase in competition for jobs would also help fill less desirable roles such as those in A&E departments and general practice. The think-tank said the typical charge for a consultant from an agency was £1,760 a day, equivalent to a salary of £459,000. Because the salary of an NHS consultant was between £75,249 and £101,451, four consultants could be employed for the price of one agency staff member.","Foreign GPs now account for 1 in 5 family doctors, new NHS figures show .

Corinna Skorpenske, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took to Facebook to publicly shame the anonymous note writer, while also defending her daughter Harley Jo, a student at Ohio State University, and her condition. 'My first reaction was anger,' Corinna told Yahoo Health. 'On top of everything she deals with she didn't need this. Harley is very strong, and many times she just lets it go. But because she is human I know she feels something.' Noted: Harley Jo Skorpenske, who suffers from lupus, discovered this note on her car after stopping at a CVS in Cleveland, Ohio . Keeping up appearances: The disability caused by Harley's illness is not visible to others, but presents her with a battle every day . The harsh note, which was left on Harley’s car, despite the fact that that her official handicap tag was clearly visible, read:  'You should be ashamed! When you take a handicap spot, an actual disabled person suffers. You were not raised as you should have been.' The person who wrote it evidently saw Harley walk into the pharmacy unaided, and assumed that she was lying about being disabled. In response to the note, Harley's mother Corinna wrote an open letter on Facebook, hoping it would eventually reach the person whose ignorance had so upset her daughter, and also aiming to raise awareness for non-visible 'ghost diseases' such as Harley's. Including a photo of the note lying on top of Harley's handicap tag, Corinna wrote in her post: 'To the person who left this on my daughter’s car. You'd never know: Harley may struggle every day, but she continues to persevere, unbeknownst to many of those around her . Mom knows best: Corrina Skorpenske (pictured) hopes to find the writer of the note and change that person's - and others' - perceptions about 'ghost diseases' 'Wishing so much for you to have stopped and talked to this amazing person before leaving this. If you had, you would have known that my daughter has a disease.' Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to attack its own tissue, leading to inflammation that results in visible swelling and joint pain. The disease affects women much more frequently than men and leaves suffers feeling extremely fatigued . The condition is also typified by a 'butterfly rash' which spreads across the face of many with the illness. There is no cure for lupus, but most of those afflicted are able to live a normal lifespan on medication. Corinna went on to explain in detail the laborious battle her daughter has been through since being diagnosed with lupus aged 16. 'It started with her joints swelling and the pain being so bad she could hardly walk,' Corinna said. 'But she continued going to school and keeping up with her community service.' The teenager went on to suffer a facial rash and hair loss - and had to attend her prom in a wig. She would go on to battle debilitating muscle pain, hearing loss, multiple lung collapses and a month-long stay in the hospital that forced her to postpone her studies. But, incredibly, the young lady always made it back - although 'not at 100 per cent' her mother explained. 'She struggles every day with permanent damage she has had to one side of her body and with hearing loss, but baby she keeps going!' gushed Corinna in the letter. 'I think you would love her': Harley's mother leapt to her daughter's (pictured) defense in an open letter, describing her as a fighter and an 'amazing person' 'I may not be a perfect parent, but I know I did good with her!' Corinna's letter is finished with a plea to the writer of the note, saying she hopes to find him or her: 'Not to tell you how wrong you were in leaving that note...but to give you the opportunity to meet My Girl. I think you would love her [sic].' 'People with ghost illnesses are often labeled as lazy or fakes,' Corinna told Yahoo Health. 'We never know what burdens people struggle with. Often we are so quick to judge or make assumptions, but if we just take the time to ask them, they are often very willing to educate them on it. Their pain and discomfort is real.'","Corrina Skorpenske, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took to Facebook to publicly shame the person who left a cruel note on her daughter’s car .

The man posed as a member of the congregation of St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester to carry out the crime. As well as taking one bag, he tried to steal the contents of two other elderly women's bags before fleeing. Police have released an e-fit and CCTV footage after a thief stole a pensioner's handbag from a church . The thief sat down in a pew next to the 86-year-old for the Good Friday service earlier this month. After grabbing the bag, he targeted an 82-year-old woman but she was alerted when she heard him rustling in her purse. As he fled the church, the thief tried to snatch the handbag from a third woman, also aged 86. But instinctively the woman pushed the thief away as he tried to pull the bag from her shoulder and he ran off. Police have described the incident on April 3 as 'appalling' and have released an e-fit image of the suspected offender. They are appealing to anyone who recognises him to come forward. The thief is described as being a white man, in his 40s of a medium build and wearing a grey hooded top. The incident happened at St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester on April 3 . Det Con Dave Bennett of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The actions of this underhand and sneaky thief are so shocking that I have no doubt people who live in this area, particularly those who worship at this church, will be very angry. 'He used an important date in the religious calendar and within the sanctity of the church grounds to target elderly women who had simply gone to the church to mark Good Friday.' He added: 'Not only did he pinch one woman's bag, but he also tried to steal two other handbags and was only stopped in his tracks thanks to the vigilance of two of the women. 'It is a sinister, cowardly and disrespectful crime and we need to find the man responsible before he can target anyone else, whether they will elderly people or those attending at the church. 'We have released an accurate likeness of this offender and I would urge people to look very carefully at the image. If you recognise who this man is then please do the right thing and call us. 'Alternatively, I would urge people to be vigilant and if you think you see this man, then please call us straight away.'","Man sat next to the 86-year-old woman in church pew in Manchester .

The SNP demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds - as the latest price of propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street in the event of a hung Parliament. Miss Sturgeon said the rising retirement age was particularly unfair for pensioners in Scotland because they don’t live as long as their counterparts in the rest of the country. Raising the retirement age is unfair on Scottish pensioners because they die younger, Nicola Sturgeon declared yesterday. She is pictured at the Westerton Care Home during an election campaign visit in Glasgow . The SNP leader demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds . At the same time, she issued a demand for a huge inflation-busting increase in the State pension, which would cost billions of pounds more. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week. It is currently £113. Parts of Scotland have among the lowest life expectancies of any part of the UK. In central Glasgow it is less than 73 years for men and for women less than 79. Across Scotland the figure is about 76 for men and 80 for women. In England and Wales the figures are nearly 79 for men and nearly 83 for women. But various studies have linked lower life expectancy in Scotland to higher rates of alcohol consumption, smoking, and poor diet. It is also linked to levels of poverty and housing. Her comments will raise concerns that the SNP will demand a more expensive pension system across the whole of the UK which will benefit Scotland most. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week. It is currently £113 . Speaking on a visit to a care home in East Dunbartonshire, Miss Sturgeon said: ‘The Tory/Lib Dem government’s plan to further increase the state pension age is a worry to people across the UK who are planning for their future, but the failure to take Scotland’s specific circumstances into account is particularly unfair. ‘Our comparatively low life expectancy rate is an issue which I will do everything in my power to change but in the meantime it would be completely unacceptable for people in Scotland who have paid in to a state pension all of their lives to lose out.’ ‘That is why SNP MPs will reject any plans for a further increase in the state pension age.’ ‘Our pensioners have contributed hugely to society and are entitled to get a fair deal in their retirement in return. She said the SNP would ensure that ‘the contribution older people have made throughout their lives is recognised’ if they hold the balance of power after the election. Miss Sturgeon also issued a demand for the single tier pension to increase to at least ‘to ensure pensioners are no longer subjected to the scourge of means-tested benefits.’ The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped . A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘Capping the state pension age in Scotland will cost hardworking taxpayers across Britain more than £12.5 billion. ‘This gives another glimpse into a future with Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, in the SNP’s pocket – meaning more borrowing, more spending, and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’ On Sunday Miss Sturgeon said the SNP would be prepared to prop up a minority Labour government even if Ed Miliband lost the election. She said the party’s MPs would vote to support Labour even if the party won fewer seats than the Conservatives on May 7. The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped. For many years, the UK state pension age for men was 65 and the state pension age for women was 60. But from 2020, both men and women’s retirement age will be 66, increasing to 67 between 2026 and 2028, and then linked to life expectancy after that. The government will then review the state pension age every five years. During last year’s referendum campaign, the SNP argued the level should only increase to 66 in Scotland, because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between £10,000 and £11,000 less.","SNP said retirement age should be frozen, in a move costing billions .

539,8a0881c7bf0f9979054a087e2e135e86824e19ae,"Two property developers branded 'arrogant and greedy' by a judge have been jailed after a three-storey building collapsed trapping three people in the rubble. A doctor's wife and a student plunged from the living rooms of their flats into the basement below  and a workman was buried after a digger struck a load-bearing column. The accident left three victims hospitalised with minor injuries, while 20 students were left homeless and one of Sheffield's main arterial roads was closed for a day. Most of the students who lived in flats above the development in the Brook Hill area of the South Yorkshire city were luckily out at the time and missed the accident. Jailing brothers Naveed and Rizwan Hussain for 12 months each today, Judge Michael Murphy told them: 'It was only by the grace of God or good fortune that people were not seriously injured or killed. 'If a member of the public had been passing by they would have said ""How on earth was no-one killed in that?"" There was potential for a complete disaster. It was caused by your arrogance and greed.' Before: Students and a doctor and his wife lived above the retail premises in Sheffield until the 2013 incident. Three people were injured and the building's collapse caused the main road to be closed off . After: But the building was left looking like it had been hit by a bomb after botched work by landlords Naveed and Rizwan Hussain, who were jailed for health and safety offences today . Officers from the Health and Safety Executive spent two years and £150,000 investigating the collapse and bringing the defendants to justice for what was called a 'flagrant disregard' of Health and Safety regulations. Sheffield Crown Court heard that neither city landlord Naveed, 33, or Rizwan, 39, had any building experience, qualifications or planning permission for the structural works they were carrying out. Rizwan, who managed the shop in the building, and Naveed, the landlord of the flats above, were hoping to extend and reopen a former Indian restaurant on the site. Nigel Lawrence, prosecuting, said the flats above the retail premises were occupied by Sheffield University students as well as a doctor and his wife. A builder and a structural engineer were consulted over plans to lower the floor level and make the restaurant open-plan but the brothers then dispensed with their services. Although a planning application was submitted, permission had not been grantedwhen construction work on the restaurant started about four weeks before the collapse in March 2013. The student tenants complained about cracks in their walls and noise from drilling and machinery but Rizwan told them the restaurant would be open within four months and he would offer them jobs there. Naveed brought in an excavator and began removing rubble with the help of an odd-job man while Rizwan instructed other workmen. Pillars and internal walls were removed. Firemen had to make the building safe after the wall and upper floors caved in in March 2103 . The work meant a main road in Sheffield was closed off. The section of the building was later demolished . As the work progressed, the doctor confronted Naveed in the basement and was shocked to see the underside of the laminate floor in his flat above supported only by steel beams with large areas of wall removed. 'He asked Naveed if he and his wife should vacate the flat but Naveed assured him this was not necessary,' said Mr Lawrence. A week later student Kishore Chandrasekaran was in his flat when the wall and the floor collapsed, dropping him down onto a pile of rubble in the basement. He was trapped by his right leg but a table which fell on top of him protected him from falling debris. It was half an hour before he managed to struggle free. Doctor's wife Khushboo Shah was sat on the sofa in her lounge. 'She heard a noise like hailstones and the floor beneath her fell away and she fell to the basement together with a section of the building', said Mr Lawrence. She fell on the rubble and was covered in dust as well as being struck by falling pieces of wood. Both the first and second floors of the buildings collapsed and Naveed himself freed the handyman, known only as Mr Raja, from the rubble. The students lost their passports and laptops and their deposits on the flats were not returned. The part-ruined buildings were demolished by Sheffield City Council on safety grounds - with the taxpayer picking up the bill. Before the incident, two storeys of flats sat above the premises the brothers were trying to convert . An independent structural engineer called in to examine the mess said the work was 'inherently dangerous and a serious accident was foreseeable.' Mr Lawrence said: 'It was a miracle that nobody was either killed or seriously injured. It was pure good luck that most of the tenants were out of their homes and no member of the public was nearby.' David Webster for Naveed, a father-of-four who was convicted last year of unlawfully evicting a tenant, said the work was not 'wholly cavalier' from the outset but a measure of cost-cutting overtook prudence. 'The work was done with a highly reckless disregard not only for the safety of others but to my client himself,' he said. 'If there was anybody at the greatest risk it was the one who was in the basement. 'This was hamfisted, clueless, directionless and haphazard rather than calculated maliciousness in bringing down a building. His folly was to think he could turn his hand to this major project without any relevant training or experience.' James Horne, for Rizwan, said his involvement was confined to running the shop in the buildings owned by his father Sabir Hussain. The court heard had no financial interest in the flats and the intention was for the work to be done properly. Now builders are trying to completely re-build the premises after huge disruption caused by the accident . The court heard the father-of-seven had taken out a £488,000 bridging loan on the restaurant project guaranteed by properties belonging to his brother and was currently working as a chef. Naveed and Rizwan both admitted two offences contravening HSE regulations in failing to ensure themselves and their employees were not exposed to risk and failing to take steps to prevent danger to another person. Rizwan also admitted breaching a prohibition notice. As well as being jailed, Naveed was fined £40,000 and Rizwan was given a £42,000 fine. Naveed was ordered to pay £60,000 costs and Rizwan £40,000 costs. Judge Murphy told the brothers that their breaches of the regulations were 'blatant and financially motivated'. He said: 'People were terrified and there was inconvenience to untold numbers of people in Sheffield. The potential for disaster was staring everyone in the face apart from you.'","Completely unqualified brothers were trying to create an Indian restaurant .

540,d03c027ade8d87204f547dc66653a7b95395262f,"Sally Cox, 39, stopped her son Jed Pearce, 10 (pictured together above), from going on the mosque trip, expressing fears of 'violence and guns' Children as young as eight have been banned by their parents from attending a British mosque as part of a school trip over 'safety' fears, with one mother claiming she 'doesn't want to put her son at risk of being shot'. Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon, as part of an RE trip to learn about different faiths. The schoolchildren, from years three to six, were due to visit the city's cathedral before taking a tour of the mosque and observing a congregational prayer. However, about 10 pupils have now pulled out of next week's school trip after their parents said they  would be exposed to 'violence and guns' and expressed 'grave concerns' about the teaching of Islam. Christine Trevethen, 47, a housewife from Lostwithiel, Cornwall, has stopped her 10-year-old daughter Keira going on the visit. She said: 'We are not the only ones that don't want our kids to go - but a lot of the others haven't been honest enough to do so in the consent form. 'I do not want my daughter going to the mosque for personal reasons. I don't agree with the religion and what it stands for - but I am not prepared to go into the reasons why. 'We have now been told our children are going to be excluded from RE lessons as a result, which is a big concern. 'We tried to go through the right channels but the school handled it very badly.' Sally Cox, 39, a self-employed cleaner from Lerryn, Cornwall, has also blocked her son Jed Pearce, 10, from going on the visit. She said: 'I did not want him to go because they are a violent religion and many of them have guns. 'You can see what they are like every day on the news. There was a Muslim bomber in Exeter just a few years ago. 'We were just being honest saying we did not want them to go. 'It is unsafe. I don't want my son being shot. Also this is not a religious school yet they are willing to take a whole day out for religion. 'I don't want them to do that. I want him to be in school learning Maths and English - not being put at risk of being shot. 'They decided to take him out of RE, but I said I am fine with that.' Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon (pictured) as part of an RE trip  but 10 pulled out after parents expressed 'grave concerns' Another parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'We have grave concerns about the children's safety during the trip due to the horrific events that occur every day. 'We have therefore decided not to send our children on this trip. This decision is not one based on ignorance or racial or religious beliefs, but one based purely on safety concerns.' The parent said she was furious after the pupils who pulled out of the trip were singled out in a school assembly. She said: 'They were made to stand up after assembly. The sitting non-attendees were then asked individually why they were not going on the trip. 'This is not a decision the children have made, so discriminating against these children in this fashion is disgraceful, unacceptable and unprofessional.' However, not all parents are opposed to the trip, with some backing the school and suggesting the visit is a positive move. Alice Mitchell, 35, a playworker from Lostwithiel, said: 'I think we need to educate our children to be tolerant and dispel the rumours the media can congregate. 'I am all for my children going on the trip. I think celebrating diversity is a great thing. 'It is all down to fear. People are scared of other religions. There is a lot of misconceptions.' And Sian Cornish, 41, a self-employed retailer, from Lostwithiel, added:' 'I did not even realise it was an issue. I was delighted my child had the opportunity to experience another culture in their ways of worship. 'I think it is important to celebrate other cultures - even if you don't agree with them.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of Lostwithiel School (pictured), which has just 156 pupils on its books, said the trip would still take place on May 7 to 'show children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam' Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the school, said a group of parents had expressed concerns about the trip due to recent terror attacks by groups such as ISIS. She said: 'This is the first time pupils from the school have visited a mosque and it's an exciting opportunity for them to learn about different faiths and ensure that they're aware of the diverse nature of modern Britain. 'Because of recent news reports about extremist groups, such as ISIS, that identify themselves with Islam, a small number of parents have expressed concerns about the trip and the teaching of Islam in school. 'In response, the school held a special assembly with children to discuss these issues, and the head teacher has met and sent letters to parents with specific concerns. 'A full risk assessment has been conducted for the trip and there is no more risk attached to this trip than any other school trip.' Ms Smith said the school had a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities. She said: 'Religious Education forms part of the basic curriculum in schools and its teaching is enshrined in law. Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the Lostwithiel School, said parents expressed concerns about the teaching of Islam at the school . 'The school recognises that parents have the right to withdraw their child from RE in whole or in part, and provide alternative work to further their child's knowledge and understanding of the parents' beliefs and values. 'However, the school is aware that children growing up in Cornwall may have little contact with Muslims and it is aware that it has a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities as part of its single equality duty. 'The Governing Body fully supports this trip and the teaching of RE, including Islam. 'It is the governors' hope that the visit to the mosque will provide an insight for pupils into the nature of British Islam, help them understand how Islam is presented in the media and that groups like ISIS are not a true reflection of the Islam followed by the vast majority of Muslims in Britain.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of the primary school which has just 156 pupils on its books and teaches those aged four to 11, said the trip would still be taking place on May 7. She said: 'Our hope from the visit to the mosque is that children will be given a view as to what are the values and beliefs of a British Muslim. 'This trip will show the children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam as a religion.' Exeter Mosque, described as the 'Islamic Centre of the South West', is open daily for prayers and also welcomes those wishing to learn about the Quran and basics of the Deen. The Mosque also welcomes groups as part of education programmes and regularly hosts school trips. Lostwithiel School, which has around six teachers, said the trip was planned to enable children to learn further about different religions. The school said it follows the Cornwall Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education and part of the curriculum encourages children to study Christianity in great detail, as well as finding out about Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam through school trips, visits from outside speakers and class teaching. The Muslim Council of Great Britain said it was concerned by the views of some of the parents who strongly opposed the trip. A spokesman said: 'We would have thought a well-rounded education involves learning about those of a different faith. 'These laudable initiatives take place across the country. It is therefore disappointing to hear that some parents have chosen to pull their children out of a visit to a mosque due to events elsewhere in the world. 'We hope this incident is atypical and not reflective of a growing sentiment against Muslims in this country. 'We commend the headteacher for rightly stating that such a visit will help her pupils to understand real Islam and dispel the myths and hysteria that surrounds our religion.' MailOnline has contacted Exeter Mosque for comment.","10 pupils pull out of trip to mosque after parents express 'grave concerns'

541,7232fcc05a31e8d0015dfcaa61e025bfea1f9627,"Kansas is one signature away from telling poor families that it's illegal to use their welfare payments to buy alcohol, tobacco and pornography, to visit strip clubs or tattoo shops, and to take vacation cruises or gamble on dog or horse races. Swimming pools, jewelry and lingerie stores, psychics, movie theatre, nail salons, massage parlors, bars and theme parks will also be forbidden territory for the first time, if Republican Gov. Sam Brownback signs a bill that hit his desk last week. The proposal would also give the force of state law to some of brownback's policies, including one that requires 'temporary cash assistance' recipients to hold down jobs, look for work or enroll in job training programs. NO BENEFITS: A pending Kansas law would make it illegal for welfare recipients to spend their government-supplied stipends at strip clubs, among a laundry list of other places . NO INK: Kansas welfare recipients who want taxpayers to shell out for their tattoos have until July 1 to experiment with the latest in body art . PARTISAN: Kansas Republican Gov. Sam Brownback (center) is likely to sign the new measure despite strong opposition from Democrats . Kansans, like citizens of many other states, are issued debit cards when they register for state-based welfare. Under the rules of the bill passed in the state legislature, bail-bondsmen would no longer be allowed to accept the cards as payment. Recipients would be limited, for the first time, to withdrawing  $25 in cash per day. Liberal lawmakers complained that some welfare recipients use their debit cards to get funds for rent payments. Democratic state Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau told the Topeka Capital-Journal that forcing those people to make multiple trips to bank machines to pay their bills 'is ludicrous. It is outrageous.' State Rep. Carolyn Bridges, another Democrat, complained during a legislative debate that putting limits on how the poor can spend taxpayer dollars says to them: 'If you are asking for assistance in this state, you're sort of less than other people and we're going to tell you how and where to spend your money.' NECESSITIES: Tobacco will be added to the no-no list, along with movie tickets, cruise vactions and lingerie . I SEE A JOB IN YOUR FUTURE: Fortune tellers and psychics? Out. Job training? In. CONFLICT: Republican state Rep. Kansas state Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady (left) insists that getting welfare recipients 'back to work' justifies the new law, while state Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau (right) called it 'ludicrous' and 'outrageous' But state Sen. Michael O’Donnell, the Republican who gathered support for a House bill putting all the changes into place, said public assistance should be spent 'more responsibly' than it had been in the past. 'We’re trying to make sure those benefits are used the way they were intended' – on food and necessities like diapers or toiletries, O’Donnell told the paper. The Brownback administration has signaled its support for the measure. It has already presided over a 60 per cent drop in the number of Kansans enrolled in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, known as TANF, during his first term in office. When Brownback became governor in 2011, the program served 38,900 people statewide. Today that number has dwindled to 15,500, according to statistics compiled by the Kansas Department for Children and Families. Numbers of food stamp recipients – a completely separate category of government welfare – have ticked down by just 6 per cent during the same period, however. Poverty rates among children have remained constant, according to the social-services nonprofit group Kansas Action for Children . The clash of statistics has raised questions about whether the state has actually been moving people off of TANF and into jobs. VICIOUS CIRCLE? Benefits recipients were previously permitted to spend their government money to bail themselves and family members out of jail . YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK: Until Brownback became governor, welfare enrollees could buy liquor with their benefit debit cards, but now his policy is likely to become a law that future pols will find it hard to undo . 'This is serious, good policy for the state of Kansas,' state Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady, a Palco Republican, told the Associated Press. 'There's nothing better to get these people back on their feet than getting them a job and getting them back to work.' But Democratic state Sen. Laura Kelly countered in the Capital-Journal that 'we pat ourselves on the back that our TANF rolls have gone down exponentially and we say it’s because all those people are now working,' but 'we don’t know that and I’m guessing its not the truth.' Another Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Barbara Ballard, complained during a debate that telling welfare recipients that they can't use their state benefits to visit swimming pools would give the poor one fewer way to stay healthy. Republicans control both the Kansas House and Senate by wide margins. THe House vote was 87-35, and the Senate passed the bill 30-10. If Brownback signs the bill, it will go into effect in July.","'Temporary Assistance for Needy Families' funds can buy goods and services beyond food and necessities intended by program's designers .

543,1f42cfb9302d4528339099a361998a892f3cac5e,"All the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics . Out on the election campaign trail under blue skies in South Wales, the trade union firebrand's manner was as warm as the weather. 'Didn't you once call me a slab-faced Marxist?' the famously militant leader of Unite asked me with a grin that was more genial than menacing. I had to confess I had. But that did not stop 'Red' Len McCluskey giving me the time of day on a street in Neath as he conducted a two-day tour of the Principality to drum up support for Labour's cause. Watching him in action, it was clear that he is highly popular with activists. His gospel of traditional hard-left socialism goes down well with the converted, as does his hackneyed anti-Conservative bile. 'We look to Wales as a beacon of hope to show what a Labour government can do. The Tories might have the money but we've got the working people on our side,' he said to cheers and applause. Yet all the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics, seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the Labour movement to drag Britain back to the dark days of the 1970s. As the Mail reveals today, the sheer scale of the influence Unite holds on scores of Labour candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose. Indeed, McCluskey, a former Liverpool dock worker who keeps a drawing of Lenin in his office and once boasted of presiding over more strikes than any other union boss, is quite open about his yearning for that period when the unions held the government to ransom: 'We are supposed to believe that the Seventies was a horrible time. It wasn't. It was a time of great advances for working people,' he has said. Labour's umbilical link to McCluskey's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left-wing, anti-austerity SNP, yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country. Not only is Unite – which has a claimed membership of 1.42million – intertwined with the Labour Party's structure, MPs and finances, but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past, including a major expansion in the public sector, less flexibility in the workplace, higher taxation and ever more state spending. Just like Nicola Sturgeon, McCluskey wants to make Labour bolder, 'more radical, courageous and brave'. Only last month, he appeared to threaten illegal action if a Tory Government pushed through further restrictions on strikes in the public sector. 'When the law is misguided, when it oppresses people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question, I'm giving the answer. It ain't going to happen,' he declared. Despite all his talk about the oppression of working people, however, he has not done badly for himself. Last year it was revealed he received a £5,000 rise, taking his pay and pensions package to £140,281. McCluskey has denied that he has too much influence over Ed Miliband, adding that Unite is supporting the party '100 per cent' McCluskey's determination to influence Labour was all too evident in Wales. With an air of quasi-regal grandeur, he visited several factories, gave talks to Labour activists and held a number of photo opportunities – including one in Cardiff at the statute of that old champagne socialist Nye Bevan. When I spoke to McCluskey, he downplayed his hardline socialism, instead talking about the need for investment in industry and the economy. And he denied that he had too much influence over Ed Miliband's party: 'If only that were true,' he said, while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause. 'Unite is supporting Labour 100 per cent,' he said, adding that is now campaigning 'all over the country'. Yet there was something synthetic about McCluskey's protestations of support for Labour. As I watched him at close quarters, it became more apparent that he was going through the motions. When asked in an interview with BBC Radio Wales about Miliband's leadership, McCluskey could say only: 'He's doing OK'. Beneath the surface, I have no doubt he longs to hear Ed offering more nakedly socialist policies, rather than trying to appeal to Middle England. Moreover, if Labour and Unite really think that McCluskey is an asset in the election, they are doing their best to keep quiet about it. When I tried to find out McCluskey's schedule for his Welsh visit from any number of Unite and Labour sources, including McCluskey's own press officer, I was greeted with either hostility or silence. No one would give me any information. It was only through persistence and good luck that I managed to track him down, to the outrage of his press officer who asked me paranoiacally: 'How did you find us? Did you fit a tracking device to Len's car?' That kind of anxiety and suspicion shows more than just a lack of confidence. It reveals a fear that, just as with Sturgeon's spendthrift radicalism, the hard-Left dogma of Unite is likely to alienate floating middle-of-the-road voters. Such fears are, of course, only too justified. For this is no small-town demagogue. On the contrary, McCluskey is pivotal to Labour's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David, who enjoyed greater popularity among Labour MPs and the rank and file. Since 2010, Unite is estimated to have donated at least £14.4million to Labour's coffers. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband (pictured left) was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David (right) The dominance of Unite runs right through Labour's organisation, with huge implications for the make-up of a putative Miliband government. One recent analysis showed that 159 Labour MPs from the last parliament receive sponsorship from Unite or are members of the union, including senior frontbenchers such as Harriet Harman, Angela Eagle, Hilary Benn and Sadiq Khan. In addition, 133 Labour candidates at this election are reported to have links to Unite. As Martin Mayer, chairman of Unite's political committee and a member of Labour's National Executive recently admitted, the union is involved in a 'serious attempt to win back the party'. Tragically for Britain, there is now a real danger that an incoming Labour government would be forced to lurch even further to the Left, not just by SNP by also by Unite, with Miliband too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in Downing Street.","The scale of influence Unite holds is chilling given what it seeks to impose .
It remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of Britain's past .
Mr McClusky denies holding too much power over Labour's Ed Miliband ."

A new poll by YouGov ahead of Charles and Camilla's 10th wedding anniversary reveals that 49 per cent think Camilla should take the traditional title of the wife of a reigning king, while 35 per cent believe she should be given a lesser title out of respect to Diana, Princess of Wales and 16 per cent were undecided. When the Prince and Camilla became engaged in February 2005, only 7 per cent of people polled by YouGov thought Camilla should one day be Queen. Scroll down for video . Almost half of all Britons believe Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, right, should become Queen when Prince Charles accedes to the throne although 35 per cent believe she should be rewarded with a lesser title . Half of those polled believe that Camilla, right, does a good job of carrying out her official duties . Aides have always insisted the Duchess does not want to be known as Queen and intends to be known as Princess Consort instead. But according to some legal experts, unless there is change in the law, Camilla will technically become Queen no matter what title she actually uses. Most people (42 per cent) said they had neither a positive or negative impression of Camilla, with 31 per cent saying they had a positive one and 23 per cent a negative one. But the survey of 1,830 people also showed that 44 per cent believed Camilla was well prepared to be the wife of the reigning monarch, 13 per cent thought she was badly prepared and the remainder had no opinion or did not know. Of those questioned, 50 per cent thought Camilla had carried out her duties as Duchess of Cornwall well - with 20 per cent saying she did this very well and 30 per cent fairly well. Only 6 per cent thought she had done badly in the role. Some 28 per cent had no opinion and 16 per cent did not know. Nicola Wildash, research executive at YouGov, suggested it was more a case of people becoming used to Camilla, rather than a large surge in popularity. 'The further we get from Diana's death, the less that will resonate in people's minds. As soon as the public see something for years and years, they become more neutralised to the issue,' she said. Prince Charles, left, and Camilla, right, are preparing to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary . Figures from YouGov in June last year showed 53 per cent thought Camilla should one day become Queen Consort, 32 per cent believed she should have a lesser title and 14 per cent did not know. But Ms Wildash said the slight decrease from 53 per cent to 49 per cent was not significant and part of a general small fluctuation. Almost two fifths (39 per cent) said they believed the Queen was happy with Camilla's performance as the Duchess of Cornwall, with only 9 per cent thinking the monarch was unhappy. Regarding Charles, 29 per cent think he is performing his duties as Prince of Wales better than he did 10 years ago, while 7 per cent think he is performing his duties worse than a decade ago. But 27 per cent think he was already performing his duties well and there has been no difference during the 10 years and 12 per cent believe there is no difference and he is still performing his duties poorly.","Prince Charles and Camilla  will celebrate their anniversary later this week .

The latest research suggests Swedish passports are among the most frequently sold in underground trading, as there is no upper limit on the number of replacements available to the rightful holder. They can sell for as much as £6,000 each – far more than the £28 fee that Sweden’s government charges for new or renewed travel documents. Sweden's passport was among the most frequently sold travel documents on the black market . The findings are contained in a new GoEuro infographic which ranks the world’s most powerful passports and takes a look at quirky facts . When placed under an ultraviolet light a Canadian passport displays colourful images on its pages, including the Parliament building in Ottawa. The Finnish passport displays a walking moose when the pages are flipped, while the cover of Belgium’s passports offer three different sequences of languages, starting with Dutch, French or German. Meanwhile, the British passport is also one of the most powerful travel documents on the planet, but it doesn't come cheap. Britons have one of the most powerful passports in the world, allowing visa-free access to 174 countries . The study suggests that UK travellers are paying some of the highest passport costs in the world, with fees being far less in places such as Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Czech Republic, China and Russia. Research by travel website GoEuro found that the British passport is the 11th most expensive of 51 countries included in the study, and it takes a worker earning minimum wage 11 hours to pay it off. The UAE has the most affordable passport at just £9, while Turkey has the most expensive at £166, said Berlin-based GoEuro. Based on its research the travel website named Sweden's passport the most powerful in the world. It allows visa-free entry into 174 countries – the same as Finland, Germany, the UK and the US – but was ranked No 1 by the website due to its cost. Swedes pay just £28 for a passport, with GoEuro claiming that it takes only one hour for the average worker to pay it off. Sweden doesn’t have a legal minimum wage, and salaries are determined through collective bargaining. When cost is used as the deciding factor, the UK passport is the fourth most powerful in the world – behind Sweden, Finland and Germany – with a fee of £73. In Liberia, it would take a worker earning minimum wage 278 hours to pay off the country's £33 passport. And it appears travellers around the world would love to get their hands on a UK passport. In a recent poll 20 per cent of those surveyed said they would choose a UK passport if they could get an extra nationality in addition to their own, even though it is one of the most expensive in the world. It was followed by passports for the US (18 per cent), Switzerland (17 per cent), Germany (10 per cent) and Canada and Australia with nine per cent each.","A British passport allows for visa-free access to 174 countries .

546,7d8389d498d79d1bcc367fa3c83e592386f2ce06,"Around one in seven couples suffer with infertility and an increasing number are seeking alternative therapies in the hope it will bring them a longed for baby. Those who can afford it can turn to London's famous private medical haven Harley Street, where Dr Xiao-Ping Zhai has been helping women conceive for decades using only traditional Chinese medicine. Now she's invited BBC cameras inside The Zhai Clinic, which she opened in 1996, to reveal the secrets of her success. Dr Xiao-Ping Zhai says she has used Chinese medicine to help a thousand women become pregnant . 'I'm a doctor who initially trained in western medicine, then I studied Chinese medicine as I realised lots of problems couldn't be overcome by traditional western medicine,' she explains to Vanessa Engle for the documentary Inside Harley Street, which airs tonight on BBC2. Dr Zhai's methods include acupuncture and prescribing a bespoke combination of Chinese herbs which must be taken day and night. The herbs may be drunk as a tea or are provided as a vitamin tablet - 12 must be taken in the morning and 12 in the evening. The vitamins contain natural ingredients such goji berries, Chinese yan and ginger. Dr Zhai says as a result of her natural remedies: 'I have brought more than one thousand babies into the world.' One of them was advertising director Jane Parker's son Rupert. He was conceived when she was 40. Dr Zhai prescribes a bespoke course of vitamins - 24 tablets a day for two weeks - containing Chinese herbs to help conception (file photo) Jane, from London, previously told the Mail On Sunday how she fell pregnant using Dr Zhai's methods after two failed cycles of IVF. She said: 'I'd read an article about her, and had arranged it even before I'd had the IVF – she had a long waiting list. I was in an emotional state of shock when I saw her in December 2008. 'I was convinced she was going to tell me I was too old. Yet she was incredibly reassuring, giving me confidence without raising my hopes to unrealistic levels. 'She ran a series of checks including blood tests and scans. She only prescribes after she's been through the results. 'In January 2009, alongside regular acupuncture sessions, I started taking specially prepared herbs, following her advice on which supplements to take and made several changes to my lifestyle (including giving up alcohol, taking no vigorous exercise and avoiding cold drinks). 'One month later, I’d just returned from holiday and realised my period was late. I bought a pregnancy test and discovered I was expecting! I carried on with the acupuncture, herbs and supplements throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. 'I gave birth to Rupert in November 2009 when I was 41. I genuinely believe that if I hadn’t seen Dr Zhai, I wouldn't have my son.' The new BBC documentary, which airs this evening follows May Lyang, 36, who hopes to have a success story like Jane's after five years of trying. She turned to Dr Zhai after losing a baby she conceived via IVF treatment on the NHS. Jane Parker had her son Rupert in 2009 when she was 41 after having treatment at Dr Zhai's clinic . She said: 'I got pregnant and I carried through for 11 weeks but then I miscarried a month ago. 'I think about it every day but you have to move on so that's why I'm here. You have to take positive steps and not think about what is lost.' May has an initial consultation with Dr Zhai which costs £250 for an hour. During the assessment, Dr Zhai quizzes her on her lifestyle and observes that she doesn't appear to be in the best health because of the appearance of her tongue and her pale complexion. But she tells her she had potential and she's confident she will conceive. May pays £300 a month for tea made from Chinese herbs. Further check-ups with Dr Zhai will cost her £130, while three sessions of acupuncture at the clinic cost £350. After a period taking the Chinese herbal tea, she is then prescribed a mixture of Chinese herbs in a pill form which must be taken 24 times a day (12 in the morning and 12 in the evening) for two weeks, costing around £150. The BBC documentary catches up with May months on from her first appointment with Dr Zhai and while she still hasn't become pregnant, she remains hopeful. She said: 'I've got the clinic on my side, this can happen. It doesn't bother me that I'm not pregnant yet. At my last consultation, Dr Zhai said I'm not ready yet, I need to fix what's inside.' But May adds that if she still doesn't fall pregnant, she will ditch the alternative therapies in favour of IVF on the NHS again. Dr Zhai said acupuncture aids fertility because it 'promotes your body's natural healing response and stimulates natural energy flow' In her book, How To Get Pregnant, Dr Zhai said her methods work for those who can't be helped by IVF. She writes: 'I believe that our success rate is high because most patients who have trouble conceiving are not suffering from mechanical problems such as blocked fallopian tubes (these can be fixed by surgery or bypassed using IVF). Goji berries are one of the ingredients that may be found in Dr Zhai's fertility boosting vitamins . 'The most common causes of IVF failure are poor sperm production, poor quality eggs, malfunction of the ovaries or the blood supply with the abdomen not being healthy enough. 'Couples who find it difficult to conceive have problems that can often be helped by kick-starting the reproductive system, improving sperm quality and quantity and improving the menstrual cycle.' She said the herbal medicine, combined with a change to a healthy diet and light exercise, can work because: 'Herbal medicine has powerful healing properties which work on the internal organs and the reproductive system. 'It aims to clear obstruction, rectifies the balance between yin and yang in the organs and helps to restore normal bodily functions.' She also claimed: 'Most importantly, herbs have proved capable of reducing chromosomal abnormality in male sperm and female eggs so improving quality of both.' When it comes to another of her recommended treatments - acupuncture - she writes on her website: 'Acupuncture is believed to work by promoting your body's natural healing response and stimulating and balancing natural energy flow (known as Qi or chi). The BBC documentary Inside Harley Street also looks at other alternative therapies on offer for various ailments. 'Leech therapist' Maryam Rahbari, pictured, says the worms can work wonders for the health . 'Practitioners are trained to understand that the network of the energy pathway (known as meridians) that connect the organs of the body. 'When one of these pathways becomes blocked or malfunctions, problems such as pain, illness or disease may result. 'By stimulating the specific acupuncture points, TCM [traditional Chinese medicine] practitioners are trained to clear blockages in the body's meridian system, with the aim of restoring balance in the body.' Acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into the skin and is an ancient Chinese treatment that is being embraced more widely in the west for problems such as stress and back pain. It has not yet been  proven to help women conceive but it is thought to increase the chances - possibly because it makes a woman more relaxed. As well as looking at alternative therapies for infertility on Harley Street, tonight's documentary also looks at the other unusual treatments - such as applying leeches to the skin to relieve pain - that people are turning to when traditional western medicine hasn't helped them.

547,f7961c214ea5abb41508ae743d26565f7c366b5e,"The 20-year-old deranged pizza delivery driver on trial for stabbing and strangling his roommate to death before having sex with her corpse was found guilty of first-degree murder on Thursday and sentenced to two life terms in prison. The Florida court heard  how Bryan Santana was living out some kind of sick fantasy when he removed all the lightbulbs of the Orlando home he shared with Shelby Fazio, 23, before waiting for the young woman to return, killing her and then abusing her body in October last year. Jurors were told Santana first choked Fazio in a headlock before wrapping a belt around her neck and stabbing her with a hunting knife. He then killed and mutilated her dog, and wrote messages in blood on the wall, including: ''I'm not sorry for what I did.' The panel took just two hours to deliberate on Thursday, and Fazio's family cried in their seats as the verdict was handed down. Maniac: Bryan Santana, 20, of Orlando, Florida, was found guilty of the the cold-blooded murder of his roommate, Shelby Fazio, 23, on Thursday. He was sentenced to life terms in prison . In court: The trial in Orlando lasted just three days, with Santana previously admitted to murdering the victim and raping her corpse, with the jury deliberating for two hours . Overcome: Family members of the victim, Shelby Fazio, weep as her killer is found guilty on Thursday . 'This is endless': Afterwards the family said they will 'never escape' the death of the young woman, who was murdered by her roommate, Bryan Santana . 'You will not be remembered. Oh but Shelby will': Judge Renee Roche was scathing in her closing statements, saying Santana 'no glimmer of humanity' Judge Renee Roche said Santana has 'no glimmer of humanity', according to WFTV. 'You will not be remembered. Oh but Shelby will,' Judge Roche said. 'Even her beloved dog will be remembered longer than the defendant.' Cindy Fazio, the victim's mother, said they will never properly deal with her death. 'No more pleasures in life. Each day is just another we don't have with Shelby. No more good days, only days we get through,' said Fazio's mother, Cindy Fazio. She called Santana a 'violent coward.' The victim's father, Terry Fazio, added: 'This is endless. We'll never escape. Hope you get it as bad as you did to Shelby.' Roche gave Santana two life sentences for the murder of Fazio and attempted murder of his second roommate. He was also found guilty of cruelty to animals, abuse of a dead human body and two counts of grand theft. Bryan Santana (left) of Orlando, Florida murdered his roommate Shelby Fazio (right) in October and sexually abused her dead body. He then killed her dog, stole their other roommates car, and went to get a haircut . Santana was also charged with attempted murder for allegedly attacking their third roommate with a knife and killing Fazio's dog (above), and using its blood to write messages on the wall . Prosecutors said Santana 'delighted' in the pain he allegedly caused the young woman. 'He delights in every moment of telling explicitly what he had done to Shelby,' Assistant State Attorney Mark Interlicchio told jurors during opening statements on Wednesday. The Orlando Sentinel reported Santana even messaged a friend and forewarned what was to come, claiming he was going to 'gut' someone, and then saying; 'I have zero money to pay my $400 rent so I'm going to do what I want. I will fulfill my deepest desires.' Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Charlie Murphy took to the stand on Wednesday, describing the grizzly scene he discovered when he arrived at the residence Fazio and Santana shared. 'I noticed a body laying on the ground, the door hit the left leg of the body,' he said. 'She was naked. I remember she had a belt around her throat and some type of pen or pencil shoved into her neck.' This came just days after Santana's lawyer argued that he is not competent to stand trial following an incident where he smeared feces all over himself and tried to hit a corrections officer at the courthouse during opening statements in the case. 'He has now soiled himself and smeared himself in feces and smeared the wall,' said Judge Renee Roche after the incident, according to WKMG. 'I've ordered security to clean him up and bring him up here in full restraints.' And while she allowed two doctors to examine the young man, she has made it clear that she has no time for this behavior. 'He certainly knows how to behave himself in the courtroom. He behaved himself very well yesterday. Now that the train is coming down the tracks at full speed, we are seeing some other behavior,' she said. 'I will not tolerate disruption in this courtroom. If I have to gag him, I will. If I have to remove him I will.' In earlier court documents, Santana confessed to the strangling, stabbing and sexual intercourse. He also claimed he has multiple personalities, including one named 'Michael.' In court documents, Santana (right) admitted to strangling and stabbing Fazio (left), a Disney World employee, to death, and then having sex with her corpse . Fazio, 23, had moved in with the young man to begin a job at Disney World. The two had a third roommate who Santana also allegedly tried to kill. That roommate claims Santana pepper sprayed him and came at him with a knife. 'He came at me, pepper sprayed me, I tried to knock the knife out of his hand and was successful in doing that,' said John Heermance. 'And then we wrestled in the living room area.' Heermance then testified on Wednesday that at this point Santana told him to go into his room and everything would be fine. After the incident, Santana is believed to have taken Fazio's car and tried to go to a Walmart to buy a toy gun in hopes that he would be shot dead if he pointed it at police, a jury heard. He also went and got a haircut. Friends say the young man no longer wanted to live. Laura Ramirez, a friend of Santana, said on the stand: 'He just said he was going to fulfill his fantasies.' She then added: 'He said he was going to gut her.'","Bryan Santana, 20, of Orlando, Florida, was found guilty of murdering his former roommate, Shelby Fazio, 23, on Thursday .

Hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the streets around the cathedral and one of the biggest cheer so far has been reserved for Judy Murray, who arrived just before 4.00pm looking resplendent in a white, to-the-knee overcoat with a detailed gold dress.The outfit was topped off with a dramatic gold hat. This morning, the historic cathedral saw florists toting huge bouquets of flowers arrive to decorate the church - as hailstones and showers battered the venue. Clearly unable to contain his excitement this morning, tennis ace Murray posted a tweet to his 2.98 million followers which shows his plans for the day - through the use of emojis. He tweeted an umbrella, a picture of a church, a ring, a kiss, cake, drinks including beer, cocktails and wine and ends with hearts, a face blowing a kiss and several Zzzz icons for sleep.

Andy tweeted his plans for the day through the use of emojis and it would appear he's counting on plenty of laughter, kissing and alcohol . People continue to gather outside Dunblane Cathedral just hours before the wedding is due to start at 4.30pm . The forecast for the rest of the day isn't on the couple's side although there looks like being some respite from the rain between 3pm and 4pm as guests are expected to arrive. The heavens are likely to open again around 5pm. Andy's mother Judy discussed the bad weather on social media, initially tweeting: 'Hailstones. Marvellous,' and then a few hours later: 'Snowing. White wedding.' Fans who have set up camp outside the church have found themselves battling the elements this morning as they were battered by wind, rain and sleet in short succession. Ross Hutchins (left) was a guest at the ceremony, as was former British No 1 Tim Henman and his wife . However the wet weather showed no sign of dampening the spirits of the crowds outside the cathedral. Brenda Watson travelled from Ochiltree in Ayrshire with her friend to join in the celebrations. She said: 'We forgot our hats but we're hoping the sun will shine for Andy and Kim. We're so excited about seeing them and the atmosphere is great, it's been well worth coming.' Her friend Anne Gemmell from Stair in Ayrshire said Kim's dress might be 'something lacy and just chic.' No doubt the couple will both be hoping the weather improves before the ceremony later on today - or the guests could get soaked. Murray and his brother walk into the church as they begin preparations for his wedding to Kim Sears . Hundreds of the world's media are also in place to capture the event which has sparked interest around the globe. Murray took a moment out of his wedding preparations to chat on Twitter this morning about a pre-wedding snooker game last night. Tennis player Jamie Delgado tweeted: 'Pre-wedding snooker ended in another victory for guess who? Andy Murray, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado,' to which Murray replied: 'Jamie Delgado, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado, last night was actual carnage for those boys I couldn't believe it.' The reception is being held at the 15-bedroom Cromlix House Hotel, located just outside the town, which Andy bought two years ago for £1.9 million. Fans cheer as the British tennis number one Andy Murray arrives his wedding to fiance Kim Sears . Florists have been spotted working all morning to decorate the cathedral, wheeling in huge bouquets of white hydrangeas and full-sized cherry blossom trees. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers and have been together for more than nine years. The proud Perthshire community has spent the last few days decorating the high street with bunting in preparation for the celebration which will be reported around the globe. Murray fans have been posting their best wishes on social media and Scotland's First Minister has also offered her congratulations. Hibernian FC tweeted: 'Best wishes from everybody at #Hibs to our supporter @andy_murray on his wedding day; have a great time! First dance to Sunshine on Leith?' Murray said recently he will have three best men - his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier. Sussex-born Sears, also 27, will have four bridesmaids but the style and design of her bridal gown has so far remained a secret. Several names from the world of tennis are likely to be on the guest list, with former British number one Tim Henman among those tipped to appear. Reports suggest Murray and Ms Sears had originally planned to marry at a chapel within the grounds of Cromlix House, which Murray purchased two years ago, but later opted for the 300-seat cathedral. The couple met in 2005 through tennis circles - her father Nigel is a coach and former head of women's tennis at the Lawn Tennis Association. They moved in together in 2008 and briefly split the following year before rekindling their relationship. Speculation about their engagement was fuelled by Murray who, responding to a fan's question on Twitter last year, joked that he would marry Ms Sears after Wimbledon. He was forced to point out that he was not serious but announced his engagement for real in November. Andy Murray's No 1 fans: Linda Reid-Nevitt, 62, and Amy Moffat, 15, from West Calder, wait outside of the cathedral ahead of the wedding . Murray told BBC Sport last month: 'I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. 'So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. 'I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way.' Yesterday the pair were spotted looking happy and relaxed as they arrived at the cathedral for their wedding rehearsal. Bride-to-be Kim, 27, wore skinny black jeans, a leather jacket and blue scarf as the final preparations were made for their big day.

One in five admit to doing a spot of online shopping in bed at night, according to a new study. The nocturnal shopping sprees are likely down to the 86 per cent of those surveyed who admit to turning to online retailers to purchase items that they are too embarrassed to buy in stores. The things considered too awkward for first person purchases include underwear, hair removal cream, personal hygiene products,  medication... and action figures. Nocturnal shopping spree: One in five Australians shop online at night in bed, while 86 per cent to going online for items they're too embarrassed to buy in store . And this is the least of stealthy shopper habits. The study, released by the StarTrack Online Retail Industry Awards,  found work will often take a back seat when online shopping is only a click away. More than 27 per cent of Australians confess to shopping online at work and 3 per cent even took a sick day  to be able to sign for online orders when they arrived at home. These cunning capers even extend into the offline world, with 24 per cent of shoppers confessing to trying an item on in-store with the intention of buying it online later. Confessions of a shopaholic: 13 per cent of those surveyed admit to online shopping three to four times per day . Shoppers were also found to great covert lengths to keep online shopping habits a secret from their partner, friends or  boss. With  savvy shopping skills at play, it's no surprise then that Australians admit they are online addicts. Of those surveyed, most admitted to shopping up to twice a day and 13 per cent will click through online stores three to four times a day (equivalent to 4.6 hours a week). So how much are we spending? Three-quarters of Australians will spend up to $300 per month or at least $3,600 per year, according to StarTrack. Read below to find out which type you are... 1. THE SNEAKY SHOPPER . 2. THE BLUSHING BUYER . 3. THE ADDICT . 4. THE COVERT CONSUMER . 5. THE BIG SPENDER . This old thing? Covert consumers go to great lengths to hide purchases from partners, friends and family . Pairing this alongside a recent Commonwealth Bank survey that found six million Australians were estimated to  shop online at Christmas alone, it seems online is our new go-to shopping choice. 'The relationship we have with our favourite online stores is personal and is at times extremely intimate,' Executive Chairman of the National Online Retailers Association Paul Greenberg said. 'They are co-conspirators and confidants for many of our secret shopping behaviours. Behind the safety of a screen we can be ourselves, so it's no wonder the number of Australians shopping online is continuing to grow year on year. 'To celebrate that special, unspoken bond between customers and online stores, we're asking people to wear their heart on their sleeve and vote this month for their favourite Australian online retailer in the StarTrack ORIAS People's Choice Awards.'","One in five Australians admit to shopping  in bed with the lights out .

552,060eca2f7301be29235f5aabb8ca6fbb2759df60,"(CNN)Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was once known as the murder capital of the world. Back in 2010, at the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. This month the city launched the tourism campaign ""Juarez is Waiting for You."" The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. Mayor Enrique Serrano officially kicked off the campaign, giving what he called an ""unprecedented"" high-profile tour to regional leaders from the United States and Mexico. U.S. Rep. Robert ""Beto"" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour. His congressional district includes El Paso, Texas, which sits directly across the Rio Grande. O'Rourke says there's good reason for locals to be hopeful. ""As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade. The binational ties are strong and have remained strong,"" O'Rourke says. ""Yes, we had a really difficult time for a ... period. Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world."" O'Rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men, women and children were killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez. ""(Now) I travel to Juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go. I always feel safe and secure."" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. ""That was normal,"" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. ""It's safer now."" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. ""Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped. There was a coordinated effort between agencies,"" Castaneda said. ""Without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city."" The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. O'Rourke argues that the El Paso-Juarez border is ""safer than it's ever been."" He cites the ""30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez"" last year as a symbolic step. Yet there are those who don't want to celebrate too soon. ""For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go,"" says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life. ""Just this past year (in 2014) there were 424 homicides. In 2007, there were 272. Yes, we're not as bad. But we're still very sick,"" Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez. ""In reality, we're progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity. We're still working out the corruption in the city. It's still an issue here."" With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on ""the people's participation in public matters."" In fact, the organization's slogan is ""Nothing is fixed alone. Participate."" ""We are looking at a compromised future,"" Meza said. ""We don't talk about that. We don't have the money to generate work here."" One bright spot: U.S. investment is making a comeback. American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year. That hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago. But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done. The scars from the recent past remain. Several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti. Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence. But in a sign of progress, the U.S. State Department amended its travel warning for the city. While it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution, it's no longer telling people not to come. Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed. In the last year, however, they have definitely noticed that ""life is back."" ""I measure it by the everyday coming and going of people,"" Gustavo Reveles, 39, told CNN. ""For someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis, it's encouraging to be crossing back to Juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen."" Reveles lived in Juarez until he was 15 and now lives in El Paso. He says the threat of violence is ""still a little bit concerning,"" though that hasn't stopped him in recent weeks from going to Juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks. ""Things have changed,"" he said. ""To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again. You see a semblance of what was there before. To really recover and heal wounds, there's a long way to go, but the process has started and that's a step in the right direction."" CNNMoney's Octavio Blanco contributed to this report.","Cartel violence helped make Juarez the murder capital of the world five years ago .
But the murder rate in the city has declined rapidly since 2010 .
Now city leaders are working to bring visitors and foreign investment back to Juarez ."

The monuments of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, are recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of their unique architecture. But several of the most recognisable buildings in the city, including towers and temples, now lie in rubble after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country yesterday morning. Scroll down for videos . Destruction: The Dharahara Tower, which was first built in 1832, has been almost completely obliterated by Nepal's earthquake . Historic: The now-destroyed tower was a UNESCO World Heritage Site until its destruction this weekend . Before: The Kathmandu Durbar Square, at the heart of Nepal's capital, is full of temples and historic houses with their distinctive roofs . After: The square is now piled with rubble after tall temples were brought down by the force of the earthquake . More than 2,500 people died in the quake as buildings collapsed raining down debris on the streets below, while enormous avalanches on Mount Everest left climbers dead. One of the most prominent landmarks to be destroyed by the earthquake was the Dharahara Tower, also known at the Bhimsen Tower, which has almost totally collapsed after more than 180 years of standing in Kathmandu. The 200ft tower was built in 1832 by prime minister Bhimsen Thapa as a gift to the queen, who was also his niece. It had to be rebuilt after a previous earthquake in 1934, but the latest disaster has left the tower as nothing more than a stump, killing scores of people who were trapped inside at the time. Destination: Another view of the Kathmandu Durbar Square shows how it was a thriving hub for the city . Reconstruction: Policemen were sent in to the square after it was badly affected by the quake . Venerable: The Durbar High School in the square is a neo-classical building which was shabby but grand before the earthquake . Debris: The school is now surrounded by bricks shaken from the building in the quake . Heritage: The Bhaktapur Durbar Square, pictured before the quake, is another one of the three main public spaces in the Kathmandu area . Piles: The square in Bhaktapur has rubble heaped up after its ancient temples were damaged . Kathmandu's three 'Durbar Squares', the courtyards outside the city's old royal palaces, were devastated by the earthquake, with historic temples razed to the ground by the shocks. In the largest, known as the Kathmandu Durbar Square, rubble was piled up today after a large stepped temple was obliterated in the quake. Images of the Durbar Squares in Patan and Bhaktapur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, were also devastated by the shocks. The streets of Bhaktapur were impassable because of the rubble which lay several feet deep, with fragments of religious sculptures among the stonework on the ground. In Patan, a temple had its tower broken in half, while the square was strewn with bricks. Centre: The Patan Durbar Square, pictured before the disaster, is the third major hub of the historic royal family which has been devastated . Shock: Religious sculptures were lying on the ground in Patan after the temples they were once part of collapsed . Decapitated: A statue of the Hindu deity Garud was knocked off its pedestal at Patan Durbar Square . Crooked: The stupa of a temple was almost completely ripped off by the force of the quake . Holy: The Syambhunaath Stupa, known as the monkey temple, is pictured left before and right after the quake . Witness: A monk surveys the aftermath of the quake, which left the main building untouched . The Syambhunaath Stupa, known as the 'monkey temple' which stands on a hill above the capital, also suffered severe damage. While the complex's main golden tower was thankfully untouched, many other temple buildings were totally destroyed. The Buddhist site dates back 1,500 years, and is considered one of the holiest places in the world for residents of neighbouring Tibet. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck just before midday yesterday, sending tremors through the Kathmandu Valley and the nearby city of Pokhara. Busy: The packed streets of Kathmandu pictured as they were before the disaster . Damage: A huge crack opened in the middle of the highway after the earthquake . The majority of fatalities were reported in Nepal, with deaths also being confirmed in India, Tibet, Bangladesh and the Nepal-China border. About an hour after the initial quake, a magnitude 6.6 aftershock hit and smaller aftershocks could be felt through the region for hours. Rescuers are still battling to save the lives of those trapped in the rubble, while climbers on Everest are waiting to be rescued by helicopter.","The Dharahara Tower in Kathmandu was brought down by the force of yesterday's 7.8 magnitude earthquake .

And while extreme volcanic eruptions are commonly blamed for triggering the event, research has found the majority of species on the planet were ultimately killed when the oceans became more acidic. In particular, they claim the volcanic eruptions released huge amounts of carbon dioxide which were absorbed into the oceans and changed their chemical compositions. The Great Dying, which struck the Earth 252 million years ago, wiped out more than 96% of the world's creatures. And while extreme volcanic eruptions are commonly blamed for triggering the event, research has found the majority of species on the planet were ultimately killed when the oceans became more acidic . The study, led by the University of Edinburgh, is the first to show that highly acidic oceans were to blame. And the researchers said that the amount of carbon added to the atmosphere to trigger the mass extinction was 'probably greater than today's fossil fuel reserves'. The Great Dying, also known as the Permian-Triassic Boundary extinction, took place over a 60,000-year period, and acidification of the oceans lasted for around 10,000 years. At this time, a single supercontinent called Pangaea covered the Earth. This huge landmass created extremely arid conditions and by the Late Permian, temperatures were at an all time high. These extreme temperatures already threatened many land and marine species, but this was made worse when large volcanic eruptions began to take place. Huge volumes of viscous basalt lava covered an area roughly seven times the size of France, explained the Natural History Museum, and sulphur dioxide from these eruptions caused vinegar-like acid rain to cover the Earth.

Huge volumes of viscous basalt lava covered an area roughly seven times the size of France, explained the Natural History Museum, and sulphur dioxide from these eruptions caused vinegar-like acid rain to cover the Earth. As carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere, global temperatures soared and this caused oceans to get hotter. This also caused a lack of oxygen in the world's waters, killing off marine life and destroying food chains. But it was the acidification of the oceans that was the driving force behind the deadliest phase of the extinction, which dealt a final blow to an already unstable ecosystem, the Scottish researchers said. Researchers believe this acidification  lasted for around 10,000 years. As carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere, global temperatures soared and this caused oceans to get hotter. This also caused a lack of oxygen in the world's waters, killing off marine life and destroying food chains. But it was the acidification of the oceans that was the driving force behind the deadliest phase of the extinction, which dealt a final blow to an already unstable ecosystem, the Scottish researchers said. Oceans can absorb some carbon dioxide, but the large volume released - at such a fast rate - changed their chemistry. To make these conclusions, a team led by Dr Matthew Clarkson and Professor Rachel Wood analysed rocks in the United Arab Emirates (pictured) - which were on the ocean floor at the time of the extinction. From this they developed a climate model because the rocks preserve a detailed record of changing oceanic conditions . Similar analysis in Italy found evidence of vinegar-like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in 250 million-year-old rocks. The rocks were found to contain vanillin (shown) which is usually broken down by bacteria. This proved acid in the rocks protected the vanillin, as its low pH deactivated the destructive enzymes . To make these conclusions, a team led by Dr Matthew Clarkson and Professor Rachel Wood analysed rocks in the United Arab Emirates - which were on the ocean floor at the time - to develop a climate model to work out what drove the extinction. A huge impact event has been suggested as a possible cause of the mass extinction, based on the examination of grains of 'shocked quartz' and meteorite fragments in Antarctica, but no impact site has been found. One of the attractions of the theory is that it could have triggered other causes such as the Siberian Traps eruptions. Widespread ocean anoxia - a severe deficiency of oxygen - has also been blamed for the event in the Late Permian to the Early Triassic. The spread of toxic, oxygen-depleted water would have been devastating for marine life, producing widespread die-offs. Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia - the presence of hydrogen sulphide - would have been closely associated with high levels of carbon dioxide, which suggests a combination of gases acted as a killing mechanism. The rocks preserve a detailed record of changing oceanic conditions at the time. 'Scientists have long suspected that an ocean acidification event occurred during the greatest mass extinction of all time, but direct evidence has been lacking until now,' said Dr Clarkson from the University of Edinburgh's school of geosciences. 'This is a worrying finding, considering that we can already see an increase in ocean acidity today that is the result of human carbon emissions.' The study is published in the journal Science and was carried out in collaboration with the University of Bremen, University of Exeter and the Universities of Graz, Leeds, and Cambridge. And the findings are now helping scientists understand the threat posed to marine life by modern-day ocean acidification. Dr Clarkson's research follows similar analysis  in Italy earlier this year by geologists from Imperial College London (ICL). They discovered evidence of vinegar-like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in 250 million-year-old rocks from Italy's Vigo Meano region. 'For the first time, we can say that soils from this time had an acidity similar to that of vinegar,' Mark Sephton from ICL said. The Vigo Meano rocks contained vanillin - the substance that gives vanilla its distinct taste and flavour - and this was a surprise because vanillin is typically broken down by bacteria. In an attempt to explain how vanillin could exist in the rocks for so long, the researchers turned to the dairy industry, which sometimes uses vanilla in milk. Scientists recently used satellite data to map the alkalinity of the world's oceans for the first time. The image above shows the average level of alkalinity over the past five years with blue marking water that is more acidic. By using satellite data, scientists can obtain live information as the ocean changes . Acidifying the milk protects vanillin as the low pH deactivates the enzymes that would break it down. The same can be said for vanillin in ancient rock. 'Our data fits the idea that acid rain caused the microbes to cease functioning,' said Henk Visscher, a palaeoecologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. The findings follow a similar study in 2013 by US scientists who simulated the Great Dying. The MIT researchers found that sulphur emissions from massive volcano eruptions were significant enough to create extremely acidic rain, which would have affected plant growth. They believe such acidity may have been sufficient to disfigure plants and stunt their growth, contributing to their ultimate extinction. After the eruptions ended, the researchers found believe pH levels in rain bounced back, becoming less acidic within one year. Meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on Earth . Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82 to 88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, although it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79 to 87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species.","Geologists studied rocks in the United Arab Emirates that would have been on the ocean floor during the Great Dying 252 million years ago .

Last year, the United Nations said it destroyed more than 400,000 land mines and explosive remnants of war and more than 2,000 tons of obsolete ammunition. 'I am honored to accept this role, I'm humbled that I will get the chance to work next to people who are risking their lives every day to help ordinary people live ordinary lives,' said Craig. 'I will do my very best.' Craig continued: . 'The briefing from the Secretary-General, and from all of the United Nations staff I have met, demonstrated the enormity of the task. 'The use of improvised explosive devices in Iraq, Somalia and Mali; the widespread use of 'barrel bombs' in Syria, and the landmine contamination in Cambodia, Colombia and Afghanistan must all be addressed simultaneously.

The former Aston Villa frontman joined regular hosts Martin Roberts and Lucy Alexander for the popular property renovation series as he looked to help a brother and sister-in-law put some life into a three bedroom semi-detached house in Dartford. 'Great to be here. And as you know property can be incredibly rewarding but can throw up some unexpected surprises and we've seen many of those on Home under the Hammer,' said Dublin following his introduction. Dion Dublin made his Home Under The Hammer debut as a co-host on Monday morning . The former footballer seemed to be in his element as he discusses property renovation . Homes Under the Hammer airs weekdays on BBC1 at 10am. Hosts Lucy, Martin and Dion follow house buyers from the auction room, through the troublesome process of renovating the houses they have bought. The presenters meet the buyers and make suggestions on how best to improve the property. But, ultimately, let the buyers make their own decisions. Later, they return to the property to meet the buyers and find out how improvement works have progressed. Finally a selection of local estate agents visit the property, value it and the buyers discover if they have made themselves a profit. The 45-year-old certainly seemed to know his stuff as he pointed the way around the run-down property and was brimming with ideas for first-time property developers Mike and Lucia. 'The kitchen needs an overhaul. It's all a bit 80s and needs a refurbishment. 'You could knock through the dividing wall and give yourself a kitchen diner,' expressed the retired striker as he crouched down inside the lounge. 'You could even put this wall back in to give yourself a separate lounge and you could put a table and chairs in here. I can watch the football in here and be undisturbed.' Mike and Lucia bought the Dartford property at auction for £215,000 and gave themselves a budget of just £10,000 with an original plan to replace the windows and doors. Dublin talks with first time property developers Mike and Lucia, who had purchased the semi-detached house . A before shot of the three bedroom semi-detached house in Dartford . Mike and Lucia bought the property for £215,000 and hoped to sell it on for close to £270,000 . Unfortunately the semi-detached house needed more work than originally thought as Mike revealed the pair had to spend between £25,000 and £35,000 leaving them with a total spend of £245,000. 'Oh dear,' said Dublin, before claiming the pair had made the right decision and could be set for a profit of around £25,000 if the property is re-sold for it's new estimated value of between £260,000 and £280,000. Dublin - who has a long-held interest in the property market from his football career- received plenty of plaudits from viewers via social media including high praise from IBF World Super Bantamweight champion Carl Frampton.

The China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) said on its website on Monday that provincial and national authorities will be in touch with unruly citizens when they return to China, and if necessary, the police, customs officers, border control and even bank credit agencies will be contacted. They are hoping the strict measures will encourage Chinese tourists from doing anything inappropriate or illegal while abroad. Big spenders: Shoppers from China and the Far East scramble for bargains during the Christmas sales at Selfridges in London's Oxford Street. Chinese travellers spent an incredible $164 billion on foreign trips last year . Horrific! A group of Chinese travellers who scalded a flight attendant with hot water and noodles and threatened to blow up a plane. The passengers lashed out at cabin crew after they became enraged over sitting arrangements on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing . According to China People's Daily, bad behaviour will include: disorder on public transportation－including flights－damaging public facilities or historical relics, ignoring social customs at tourism destinations, and becoming involved with gambling or prostitution. Research by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that there were 109 million Chinese tourists in 2014, who spent $164 billion. These figures are a dramatic increase from the 10 million outbound tourists in 2000, and reflected the rise in numbers of reports on disruptive behaviour. It has been suggested that higher incomes have attributed to more Chinese citizens opting to spend their holidays outside of their country. The CNTA administration said in a separate post: 'tourism reflects on the country and the people's image,' and more 'social supervision' of tourists is needed. In December a brawl started on a Chinese flight from to Chongqing to Hong Kong over a woman's crying baby .

In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' On Sunday night, Jessica Silva speaks publicly for the first time about the day, Mother’s Day 2012, when she stabbed and killed her partner, the father of her young son. Last month she walked free from court, despite being convicted of manslaughter, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all. Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica’s parents). He revealed to Michael Usher that the ordeal had so destroyed Jessica that 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I didn't recognise her' Jessica Silva admits she was living in fear and violence and she told no one. 'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said ""it was just a rash"", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' 'During the interview she gets to the point where she reveals ""my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness"". 'I don't know if there will ever be a neat ending. 'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, ""you're fat, you're ugly"", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said ""it was just a rash"". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . 'On that fateful night, Jessica made a split-second decision to save herself and her family,' according to the 60 Minutes program. 'Jessica opens up about her life with Polkinghorne and recounts what happened the night that ended in his death.' 'I didn't realise that she was going to be as raw as she still was,' Usher added. 'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how ""I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her"". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.'

An architect who was wooing 35 woman online was cleared today of raping a blind date hours after they met. Adam Leheup, 34, had denied forcing himself on the 25-year-old telling the jury the woman 'freaked out' when he tried to comfort her about her saggy breasts. During the week long trial the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed Leheup ignored her cries of 'no' and afterwards said: 'In my experience girls say no, but they don't mean it'. But following their deliberations a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court found the University of Greenwich graduate, a technical co-ordinator on the £500million Nine Elms Point Development not guilty of rape and sexual assault. The self-confessed first date addict had spent nearly a year on police bail before eventually being charged and appeared emotional, emitting a slight gasp, as he was cleared. Leheup told the jury they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. ‘I noticed she had unusually saggy breasts, she seemed uncomfortable about that,' he told the jury. 'I tried to comfort her by kissing and touching them, then she freaked out.’ He had fought back tears as he told jurors he never had sex with the young woman and didn't do anything she did not consent to. Leheup of Hersham, Surrey, revealed he was communicating with thirty-five woman at the time and regularly having sex with six of them, but stopped short with the complainant. 'She said: 'Stop' once and I turned to my side and started to go to sleep,' he told the jury. 'When girls have said nothing is going to happen, I've ended up having sex with them,' he added. The pair had met her just hours earlier on  July 9, 2013, after the pair chatted on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Leheup ended up returning to the woman's flat in the early hours of the morning after he missed his last train home. 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked,' the complainant told police, the court had heard. 'He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: 'No' a lot, but he was not listening. Leheup appeared emotional after he was cleared of the charges following a week long trial at Blackfriars Crown Court . 'I was saying: 'No', but he thought it was a joke or something. Then maybe he realised I was serious and he calmed down. 'He said: 'Girl's say: 'No', but they don't mean it.' I just wanted him out. My flatmate said she was going to call the police, but he laughed at her and said it would just be a domestic.' Parkour and free-running fan, Leheup was arrested after he left the woman's flat.

The 13-year-old boy is said to have listed 25 names of teachers and pupils he intended to kill and had told classmates of his plans as recent as last week, but none had taken him seriously. The teenager reportedly walked into the school armed with a machete and crossbow around 9.15am this morning, killing a male teacher and injuring two students and two teachers. Scroll down for video .

The teenager is said to have launched the attack in his own classroom, targeting his female Catalan teacher and her daughter, also a student at the school, Spanish media reports. According to a witness, the boy had been late for class and shot and injured the female teacher in the face, before stabbing her 13-year-old daughter. Student Gemma Jarque said she and her classmates barricaded themselves into their classroom when they heard the attack. 'We were just starting the class and suddenly we heard screams... so we shut ourselves inside our classroom in order to be safe', she said. 'We saw the teacher lying on the floor in a pool of blood.' Another student, Paula Amayuelas, said the boy had been bullied before in school. She said he 'didn't have problems but he was kind of a loner .... Other students would pick on him.' The boy is undergoing a psychiatric examination will not face criminal charges because he is under 14, the age of criminal responsibility in Spain. The victim, a male substitute teacher, had come to the aid of the woman and her daughter after hearing their screams and was shot and killed as he attempted to protect them, El Pais reports. The week before the attack, the teen had told classmates 'several times', that he was going to kill all the teachers before committing suicide, but none took him seriously and wrote it off as a bad joke.

He said the show 'wouldn't work' if there was racial diversity among its cast. Mr True-May was suspended as a result of his comments and he later quit. The long-running crime drama is set in the quiet countryside village of Midsomer where DCI John Barnaby investigates a string of murders. Executive producer Jo Wright said Dr Karimore will cause DS Nelson, played by Gwilym Lee, 'trouble in more ways than one.' Midsomer Murders began in 1997 and is watched by more than 6million viewers a week. True-May said at the time the programme just doesn't 'have ethnic minorities involved.

566,f1c14671f1c68b1b725a272efd43ad1a45cb2e5c,"(The Hollywood Reporter)Andrew Lesnie, the Oscar-winning cinematographer who spent more than a decade collaborating with director Peter Jackson on the six ""Lord of the Rings""and ""Hobbit"" films, has died. He was 59. The Sydney native, who also worked with New Zealander Jackson on the remake of ""King Kong"" (2005) and ""The Lovely Bones"" (2009), suffered a heart attack Monday. Said a spokesman from the Australian Cinematographers Society: ""We have been advised of the sudden death of Andrew,"" adding that his family would provide an official statement later. Known for balancing technology with artistic considerations, Lesnie also shot ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011), directed by Rupert Wyatt. The cinematographer recently polished off The Water Diviner, the directorial debut of Russell Crowe, another New Zealand native. That movie opened Friday in U.S. theaters. Said Crowe on Twitter: ""Devastating news from home. The master of the light, genius Andrew Lesnie has passed on."" Lesnie won his Oscar for his work on the first of the fabled ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001). His knack for getting the right feel of author J.R.R. Tolkien's most foreboding locales was remarkable. For the inaugural ""Lord of the Rings"" film, Jackson reached out to Lesnie after seeing his work on ""Babe"" (1995) and its 1998 sequel. Those Australian films, revolving around a pig and other animals, featured impressive visual effects and proved to be big hits at the worldwide box office. ""I'd never worked with him or even met him before, but he'd shot the Babe films and I thought they looked amazing, the way he'd used backlight and the sun and natural light to create a very magical effect,"" Jackson said in a 2004 interview. ""And Babe had that larger-than-life feel about it that I wanted. ""So when we began looking for DPs in early 1999, I first decided to get either an Australian or New Zealand DP, as they'd be used to the way we make films,"" Jackson continued. ""Every country is slightly different in that way, and I immediately thought of Andrew. "" Lesnie's impressive body of work also includes the post-apocalyptic science fiction film ""I Am Legend"" (2007), directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith; ""The Last Airbender"" (2010), from M. Night Shyamalan; and Healing (2014), helmed by Craig Monahan. He was inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002. Lesnie studied film and television at TAFE (a provider of vocational education) and at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School before joining the Australian Broadcasting Corp. as a camera assistant. He honed his craft on low-budget short films and music videos and assisted on documentaries, features and commercials.

567,7dd28f795024d5102a41d031d9d6d2b5209bb9d7,"David Cameron is trying to be Prime Minister without taking the job interview, Ed Miliband claimed today ahead of tonight's TV debates. The Prime Minister will be absent when Mr Miliband and four other party leaders take part in the televised showdown, after agreeing to just one direct confrontation with his rival in the race for Number 10. Mr Miliband accused the PM of 'ducking' the chance to defend his record in government or explain how he would pay for a host of tax giveaways and spending pledges. Labour leader Ed Miliband addresses supporters during a visit to Crouch End in north London this morning . Mr Cameron has pledged to find £7billion to pay for tax cuts for lower and middle earners, by lifting the point at which people start paying tax and the level when the 40p band kicks in. He has also promised to increase the NHS budget by £8billion a year, while slashing welfare spending by £12billion. Tonight's 'Challengers' Debate' will feature Mr Miliband, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett of the Greens, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. The BBC1 debate, hosted by David Dimbleby at 8pm tonight, is the second TV showdown of the campaign, following an ITV broadcast on April 2, also featuring Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg, from which no clear winner emerged. Speaking on a campaign visit to north London, Mr Miliband said: 'David Cameron has chosen not to turn up tonight to defend his record. 'Here's what I believe - I think if you are applying for the job of prime minister, the very least the British people expect is for you to turn up to the job interview. 'What I'm going to be doing is setting out the big choice facing our country, between a Labour plan to have a recovery for working families across Britain or more of the same from a government that believes that as long as you look after the rich and powerful everyone else will be okay.' The Labour leader said David Cameron was trying to be Prime Minister without taking the job interview . Tonight's 'Challengers' Debate' will feature Mr Miliband, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett of the Greens, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood . Launching the Conservatives' Scottish manifesto in Glasgow, Mr Cameron denied dodging tonight's debate. Speaking alongside the Tory leader north of the border, Ruth Davidson, at the Emirates Arena, Mr Cameron insisted he had 'unblocked the logjam' that was preventing the events happening at all. 'Tonight's debate is part of the deal that was done to unblock the logjam that there was about TV debates,' Mr Cameron said. 'You are going to hear a lot of different politicians ... while you think they may be saying different things, they are all actually saying the same thing. Ed Miliband will spend the day cramming for tonight's debate after spending the morning campaigning near his home in London . 'They are saying abandon the plan that has turned this country around and got us more jobs, more livelihoods, and more business. That is the truth.' Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in the north-west, said he asked to take part in the debate, but was 'denied the opportunity' by broadcasters. The Liberal Democrat leader told LBC radio: 'David Cameron, I know, didn't want to participate in it, but I don't see why I should have been denied the opportunity to put the side of the story of what the coalition government has done, even if he didn't want to. 'I find it very odd that the debate tonight doesn't have anybody from one of the parties that have actually been trying to govern our country.' Ms Sturgeon said the debate was 'a fantastic moment of opportunity to deliver the positive change that people are looking for'. 'The SNP will be a positive and constructive voice at Westminster, ready to join others in a progressive alliance to end austerity and protect vital public services like the NHS.' Calling on Mr Miliband to 'change direction', Ms Wood said: 'We're calling for an end to austerity and instead balancing the books through job creation and infrastructure investment. 'It's time weapons of mass destruction were confined to history and we divert funds to improve standards of living and prospects for people.' In the debate, each of the five leaders will be allowed a short opening statement before Dimbleby invites questions from 200 voters. Mr Miliband will be positioned to the far left next to Ms Wood and Mr Farage to the far right next to Ms Sturgeon with Ms Bennett in the middle of the group. The 90-minute programme will cover five subjects. Each question will see one-minute opening statements followed by 10 minutes of free debate. David Cameron took questions  with employees of telecommunications company O2 at their offices in Leeds - hundreds of miles away from tonight's TV debate in London . The Prime Minister insisted he was not trying to avoid Mr Miliband - and even claimed he had 'unblocked the log jam' stopping the debates taking place . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg gestures as he stands in front of an image of UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Prime Minister David Cameron at a campaign event in Cheadle . Responding to Mr Clegg's complaint of being excluded from the debate, a BBC spokesman said: 'Over many months the broadcasters, jointly, have worked hard to ensure that their audiences were offered the best possible combination of programmes to help them engage with the election, to inform them about the issues and to scrutinise the politicians. 'The programmes which have been agreed - including the BBC debate on the 16th - involved all sides, broadcasters and parties, making a number of compromises, allowing the different elements to go ahead. 'For each of the broadcasters, ensuring due impartiality is not only a priority, but an obligation and the BBC is satisfied that the election programmes it is offering on each of its services fulfils that obligation and that all the relevant parties will have the opportunity to put their case - and to be appropriately scrutinised.'","PM  absent tonight when five party leaders take part in TV showdown .

570,8207f0436998bb53de0562cc1e6e205b079505fc,"Bill and Hillary Clinton spent $104,000 in taxpayer money on hotel rooms for Secret Service agents when they vacationed in the Dominican Republic over the New Year's holiday. A Dominican news report says the power couple spent part of their trip staying with sugar barons Alfy and Pepe Fanjul at Casa de Campo, a private Dominican resort they own. The news outlet Listin Diario reported on January 2 that Fanjul and the Clintons discussed Hillary's presidential ambitions during the visit. Casa de Campo, a luxurious retreat for the world's super wealthy elites, is also at the center of criminal allegations now dogging a Democratic U.S. senator. LAP OF LUXURY: The Casa de Campo resort services the upper crust of America's '1 per cent' super-rich, and both Sen. Bob Menendez and Bill and Hillary Clinton have holidayed there . SAME OLD BILL: This Instagram pic, deleted from a user's account on Thursday, shows former President Clinton cavorting among yougn socialites at Casa de Campo . INDICTED: NEw Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez (left) and his wealthy donor Dr. Salomon Melgen (right) are both accused of multiple federal crimes including bribery and honest services fraud . Federal prosecutors charged New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez with corruption on Wednesday in a 14-count indictment. He is accused of accepting money and trips from wealthy donor Dr Salomon Melgen in exchange for the influence of his office. Melgen flew Menendez and his guests on a private jet to stay at his Casa de Campo villa multiple times, free of charge, prosecutors say. The doctor is also now under federal indictment, accused of bribing Menendez with gifts and approximately $700,000 in political contributions. In exchange, the government says, Menendez helped Melgen's three girlfriends get travel visas to enter the U.S., interceded with Medicare authorities when he was accused of billing fraud, and helped lay the groundwork for a Melgen-controlled company to win a lucrative port security contract in the Dominican Republic. PRIVATE VILLAS: Melgen owns a house at Casa de Campo where he entertained Menendez on several occasions at his own expense . SUGAR BARONS: Pepe Fanjul (left) and Alfy Fanjul (right) own a congromerate that includes Domino Sugar and Florida Crystals, and they also own Casa de Campo. The brothers entertained the Clintons there in early January . Melgen's 70-year-old former secretary told The Miami Herald in 2013 that Melgen had also hosted Bill Clinton at his resort home in the past. And Melgen has contributed $8,600 to Hillary Clinton's campaigns for the U.S. Senate and the White House, according to public records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. The Weekly Standard reported on Thursday that the Clintons spent the first part of their Dominican holiday three months ago at Punta Cana, a different resort area. They 'chose to spend their end-of-year vacation in the Dominican Republic's tourist hub Punta Cana,' according to Listin Diario, but on January 2 'shifted to the tourist center Casa de Campo' where they stayed with the Fanjuls. A federal government spending report describes $104,093 in payments for Secret Service lodging, but doesn't specify whether it covered rooms in one or two resort areas. FACING THE MUSIC: Dr. Melgen was in Newark, New Jersey on Thursday to face a judge for his criminal arraignment in the Senator Bob Menendez corruption case . ONE-PERCENTERS: Melgen and Fanjul have houses like this one at Casa de Campo; Bill Clinton has stayed with both of them . Bill and Hillary Clinton were photographed at both resorts. The former president attended 'private dinners with friends at their Casa de Campo villas' and played golf, according to Casa de Campo Living. Alfy Fanjul also played a small part in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that dogged Clinton's 1990s presidency and resulted in his impeachment. Lewinsky told Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr that on Presidents' Day in 1996, as Clinton was trying to break off their covert romance, Fanjul called the Oval Office. Confirmation of that phone call in White House records was one important detail that lent credibility to Lewinsky's claims that she had engaged in a series of intimate moments in the White House with the leader of the free world. WELCOME TO THE D.R.: Hillary and Bill Clinton stayed in the eastern Domonican Republic resort town of Punta Cana before shifting the vacation to Casa de Campo days later . FORE! The former president was photographed playing golf both at Punta Cana (shown) and at Casa de Campo . Security at Casa de Campo keeps out the general public. The only way onto the property for non-residents is to have a reservation at the hotel or at a home on the property. Casa de Campo itself is in La Romana province, on the southeastern coast of the Dominican Republic. The Fanjuls own the sprawling 11-square-mile resort, along with the airport that services it. It's a luxury golf and sporting resort, according to the Menendez indictment, with a marina, three golf courses, three polo fields, equestrian facilities, a 245-acre shooting facility, spa, beaches and a hotel where rooms typically cost about $500 a night.","Clintons' New Year's vacation included stay at Casa de Campo, where Sen.

Scott was the star pitcher for Will Power Fitness team in the Youth Baseball League of New Haven in 2009 when league officials informed him he could no longer pitch for his team. The budding star had five no-hitters in the team's first eight games of the season before he was told he had to sit or switch positions, the Hartford Courant reported. When his manager sent him out to the mound anyway after the ban, the other team refused to play and said its players were afraid of being injured. The story made headlines when lawyers were hired and Scott's team eventually disbanded. The budding star had five no-hitters in the team's first eight games of the season before being told to sit out . When Scott's manager sent him out to pitch after the ban was issued, the other team refused to play the game . His mother, Nicole Scott, said at the time: 'I think it's discouraging when you're telling a nine-year-old you're too good at something. 'The whole objective in life is to find something you're good at and stick with it. 'I'd rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner.' During a 2011 follow-up piece about Scott in the New Journal, his father Leroy also referenced the streets of New Haven and how some of them have 'fourteen-year-olds holding pistols'. That was four years ago, but his sentiment still rings true. A shrine  at the scene. The murder was the city's fourth homicide of 2015 and its first youth killing of the year .

The Scotts have set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for their son's memorial service and tribute. They wrote: 'Jericho, at only 16, has given so much to his family, friends and the community. 'Jericho was a highly accomplished athlete, scholar and artist.

After falling victim to bottom-side Parma in midweek, the Friuli side are vulnerable in their own stadium. Udinese have not won in their last four games and coach Andrea Stramaccioni is desperate for a positive reaction from his players. 'Against Parma, we had the wrong approach to the game,' he said. 'My players underestimated Parma and we paid the price. 'We lacked determination and didn't take a shot on goal. 'Now we must turn the page immediately and show against Palermo, the real Udinese.' Udinese were beaten by bottom-side Udinese last time out as they slip closer to the relegation zone . Udinese have struggled to deliver at home and have mustered just one win in their last nine games at Friuli stadium. The hosts must overcome the absence of defender Ivan Piris and midfielder Giampiero Pinzi, both serving a one-match ban. Palermo are without midfielder Edgar Barreto, who is sidelined for three weeks with a muscular injury. Argentinian forward Paulo Dybala, who is Palermo's top scorer with 13 goals, will lead the Rossaneri's attack on Sunday with Franco Vazquez playing in support.

With points running out and prizes at a premium, they're praying the calculator tells them the dream is still alive. But for those at the top of a claustrophobic Championship, the maths is simple — win every game or risk missing out on a potential £120million payday. Two points separate four teams, with four games remaining. To drop points would almost certainly mean to drop out of the race for the two automatic slots to the Barclays Premier League. Middlesbrough were top on Good Friday but are fourth going into the visit of Wolves. Aitor Karanka is not wasting his time on permutations.

'I think by winning four games we will get promotion, but it is very difficult. We have to forget the other teams and just concentrate on our games.' Wolves are seven points behind Boro but only outside the play-offs on goal difference after Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Midlands rivals Birmingham. And head coach Kenny Jackett admits they have played must-win games for a while. He said: 'It seems to have been that way for about three months, where we have been chasing. 'We have been working hard to make sure the sides at the top don't get away. It's good we're in this position. We want to be a Premier League club.' Callum Wilson (left) is congratulated after scoring his side's second goal against Brighton in their last game . Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe insists that his side are not getting carried away at the top of the table . The Championship leaders Bournemouth travel to Reading. And the message from Eddie Howe to his team is very much: 'Don't get ahead of yourselves'. 'With every win, we take it away from some of the teams that have been challenging all season, but I still think it is anyone's,' said Howe. 'We have to focus on every game, not get complacent, and remember that this league has a habit of throwing up surprises. We want to make sure that we stay strong until the end.' Norwich are the division's form team having won four on the spin and, ahead of their trip to Leeds, manager Alex Neil said: 'My job is simple.

Bolton Wanderers' Josh Vela (left) and Norwich City's Nathan Redmond (right) battle for the ball . Watford are the team sandwiched in third and they have the benefit of seeing how their rivals perform before they take on Nottingham Forest at the City Ground on Wednesday. The leading quartet could all guarantee their place in the play-offs at least with midweek victories. But for the chasing pack, four must go into two. Derby, Ipswich, Brentford and Wolves are within just one point of each other and must produce title-winning form between now and May 2 to be sure of post-season participation. Meanwhile, matters at the bottom of the table have been complicated after Rotherham were charged yesterday with fielding an ineligible player. Derby loanee Farrend Rawson played in their 1-0 win over Brighton on Easter Monday but there is confusion as to whether the defender had already been recalled. Rotherham are seven points above the drop zone and will nervously await the outcome of their FA hearing, especially if Millwall — with a game in hand — narrow that gap to four with victory over fellow strugglers Wigan. Elsewhere in the Football League this week, Bristol City will be Championship-bound with a win at Bradford City, while Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's Burton Albion side and Shrewsbury could leave League Two behind them if they triumph against Carlisle and Bury respectively — and other results go their way.

The unnamed man was sprinting ahead of the animal, trying to make it to the safety behind a set of iron bars when the angry animal sent him sprawling to the floor. And despite his desperate efforts to climb back up, the bull appeared to hit him right in the bottom with one of its horns as he tried to scramble away. Scroll down for video . This unlucky man was gored during a bullrunning event in Teulada, a small coastal town on Spain's Costa Blanca, after falling over in front of the beast .

The unfortunate incident happened on the street in Teulada, a small coastal town on Spain's Costa Blanca, during the annual fiesta. The celebrations begin on April 8 and last until April 19, and include floatillas and parades celebrating the town's patron saint, Sant Vicent Ferrer. As part of the fiesta, large, aggressive bulls are let loose to run around the streets, with local and visitors invited to run alongside them. The challenge is to tease the animals before escaping behind one of the wooden pallets or iron bull bars to safety. Witnesses said the man was seen limping towards medical crews after the attack, but was unsupported and appeared not to have been seriously hurt . The bullrunning takes place during the town's annual fiesta, which includes float parades in honour of Sant Vicent Ferrer, the village's patron saint . Websites advertising the bull running recommend leaving the sport to the experienced locals, noting that the animals are faster than people think, and that it is mostly foreigners that get injured.

Yesterday, as commemorations were held all over the world to mark the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, the Royal Family led tributes to those who fought and fell in the ill-fated offensive. The day began in London with a dawn ceremony at Wellington Arch on Hyde Park Corner, attended by Princess Anne.

The landings were supposed to be a decisive blow that would knock the Turks out of the war. But eight months of bloody fighting later, after an estimated 145,000 lives on both sides had been lost, the Allies pulled out, having failed in their objective. Around 58,000 Allied troops were killed, many from Australia and New Zealand. Almost 36,000 Commonwealth servicemen are buried or commemorated on Gallipoli.

A grandmother of four told of her fury today after being fined more than £500 for dropping a cigarette butt. Kim Copeland, 52, was walking home from her local Sainsbury’s store in Coventry when she threw the used cigarette on the ground - before two council officers came ‘sprinting’ towards her to say she had committed a criminal offence. Miss Copeland was then issued with a £50 fixed penalty notice following the incident in October last year, but refused to pay it within ten days in protest at how she was treated. However, after failing to pay, she eventually received a letter ordering her to appear at Nuneaton Magistrates’ Court on March 17. She was then fined £304 by magistrates who also ordered her to pay £200 court costs. Miss Copeland was unable to attend the hearing because she had to look after her son Chez, 17, who has autism, and has now criticised the city council for taking her to court. She said: ‘I was doing some shopping and was walking back home and cut through a couple of car parks. I heard these tyres screeching behind me and all of a sudden two women got out and started sprinting towards me. ‘I didn’t know whether to drop my shopping and put my hands in the air or walk towards them. I realised they had council uniforms on and they starting asking me if I was aware I had committed a criminal offence. ‘The first thing I thought was something hadn’t gone through the till properly at Sainsbury’s. I hadn’t even realised I had a cigarette. It is just automatic. 'I must have lit one up when I came out of the shop. My generation just discard the butts on the floor. If I had dumped a three-piece suite, then fair enough - but it was just a cigarette end.' Miss Copeland added: ‘They were just so stern and officious. The way they spoke to me was horrible. It is the whole manner, they acted as if I had murdered somebody.’ The grandmother, who also has three grown-up daughters, is now considering whether to pay the fine by the deadline - which is tomorrow. If she refuses she could be taken back to court. Hearing: After failing to pay Miss Copeland was told to appear at Nuneaton Magistrates' Court (pictured) Miss Copeland said: ‘I’ve been treated like I have committed a major criminal offence. I didn’t pay because of how they were towards me but also the principle. ‘I’ve always been led to believe the punishment should fit the crime and in this case it doesn’t. I find it shocking. They are now saying I will face imprisonment if I don’t pay the fine. 'I don’t want to pay it because I won’t sleep at night if I do, but I might have to. I thought they were bluffing and it was scaremongering - I can’t believe they took someone to court over something this little.’ A Coventry City Council spokesman said the authority had a ‘zero tolerance’ policy towards litter. Andrew Walster, who oversees the council’s streets policy, added: ‘It costs us about £2.5million a year to clean the streets in Coventry. There are plenty of litter bins within the city.’","Two council officers came 'sprinting' towards Kim Copeland in Coventry .

578,1361753fc103b8ae702610de85d5e7476eef5fd6,"Adam Federici lay inert on the turf for a moment. He realised the magnitude of what happened. He understood the horror of it instantly. He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe .

Arsenal: Szczesny, Debuchy, Mertesacker (Gabriel, 63), Koscielny, Gibbs, Coquelin (Walcott, 101), Cazorla, Ramsey, Ozil, Sanchez, Welbeck (Giroud, 72). Subs not used: Wilshere, Ospina,  Monreal, Flamini. Goals: Sanchez 39, 106 . When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season’s Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. ‘I am happy we are through,’ said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. ‘But I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him — I have been there, done that.’ Clarke did his best to ease Federici’s pain, too. ‘This is the life of a goalkeeper,’ said the Reading boss. ‘And Adam is a top goalkeeper. There’s every chance he’ll be Reading’s player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. ‘We stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. He’ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham I’m sure he’ll be as good as he always is.’ Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wenger’s team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenal’s fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (centre) gives instructions out to his team before the beginning of extra time . Federici’s mistake gave them an escape route that they followed eagerly. They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate. Gabriel (right), a replacement for Per Mertesacker, powers a header at goal shortly after Reading had scored .

Daniel Williams (left) shoots at goal for Reading against Arsenal at Wembley but his attempt went wide of the goal . It seemed then that Arsenal would extend their lead. Reading’s threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbs’ head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands.

579,70e68bea7eb878b2880b2f81c934ce9a686087d8,"Tottenham are considering a state-of-the-art stadium with a retractable pitch that enables them to become the home of a new NFL London franchise. The bold design of the new £400million stadium, due to be completed for the start of the 2018-19 season, could involve a ‘slide-out’ grass football pitch with an NFL-style synthetic surface housed underneath. The option of extra-large changing rooms, to accommodate NFL squad sizes that can amount to as many as 70 players at a game, is also being explored by architects. Tottenham are considering sharing their new £400m stadium with an NFL franchise . A spokesman for the north London club did not rule out the possibility this week, confirming that they are ‘looking at options’ in order to ‘future-proof the design’. The NFL is said to be within five years of having a permanent franchise in London. Indeed officials will be testing logistics when they stage their three games at Wembley this autumn, with teams looking at how quickly they can have their players back in the USA and ready to play again. The clash between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25 will kick-off at 1.30pm while the New York Jets vs Miami Dolphins game on October 4 and Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs contest on November 1 will both begin at 2.30pm. As well as allowing the NFL to experiment with a live game on TV at breakfast time in the States (9.30am Eastern time), teams are able to take advantage of the time difference and be home on American soil by Sunday night. Tottenham's new state-of-the-art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018-19 season . Spurs' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the NFL than the 90,000-seat Wembley . If Tottenham press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the NFL franchise it would represent a significant blow to the FA, who also see the NFL as a potentially lucrative partner for Wembley, their £757m stadium. But the NFL are keeping their options open at this stage in the knowledge that a new London stadium designed with American football requirements in mind would be hugely advantageous. Even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new White Hart Lane is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which Wembley boasts. Wembley does have the iconic status that the NFL finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium. Not least the fact that they have to leave the lowest 5,000 seats empty so that the view of spectators is not restricted by the mass of huge bodies on the touchline. The modern NFL stadiums make sight-lines for spectators a priority and the new White Hart Lane could overcome the problem that is experienced at Wembley by having the artificial pitch at a significantly lower level beneath the moveable grass pitch. Wembley has hosted NFL regular-season matches since the International Series began in 2007 . Detroit Lions' clash with Atlanta Falcons kicked off early, as will all three games at Wembley later this year . Retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design. England have played on two: at Gelsenkirchen in Germany during the 2006 World Cup and in the Sapporo Dome in Japan four years earlier. The Gelredome in Holland also has a retractable pitch, as does the University of Phoenix Stadium that hosted this year’s Super Bowl. The advantage for these stadiums is the ability to grow the grass in a more natural environment, outside, away from the shadows of the stands while also having the capacity to stage different events without damaging the playing surface. A feat of modern engineering, a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours. A spokesman for Tottenham said: ‘The club has always seen the new stadium as being at the heart of the regeneration of the area and it is important, therefore, to look at how we future-proof the design, as well as increasing the functionality of the stadium, whilst being conscious of community uses. At this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more.’","Tottenham's new £400m stadium due to be completed for 2018-19 season .

580,f395b6856c979acfce8d0b0b48c3eb592cd5b0b5,"US officials are expected to stop prosecuting families of American hostages who communicate with kidnappers abroad or raise funds and pay ransoms. A National Counterterrorism Center advisory group, ordered by the White House, is expected to recommend what would mark a radical shift in US hostage policy, ABC news reported on Sunday. The NCTC interviewed families of hostages, including the parents of journalist James Foley, who was killed by Islamic State fighters. The family of a US contractor held by Al-Qaeda militants, Warren Weinstein (above), confirmed they paid a ransom in an attempt to secure his release which was reported in the amount of $250,000 . Foley's mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son, and warned that her family could face prosecution for doing so. The Obama administration has denied making any such threats. 'There will be absolutely zero chance of any family member of an American held hostage overseas ever facing jail themselves, or even the threat of prosecution, for trying to free their loved ones,' a senior official told ABC News. Meanwhile, the family of US contractor Warren Weinstein, who was snatched by Al-Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, confirmed it had paid a ransom to try to secure his release, which was in the amount of $250,000, according to CBS News. A spokesman for the family said it had 'made every effort to engage with those holding him or those with the power to find and rescue him.' 'This is an ordinary American family and they are not familiar with how one manages a kidnapping,' the spokesman added. Hostage James Foley was killed by Islamic State fighters. His mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son . 'As such, they took the advice of those in government who deal with such issues on a regular basis and were disappointed that their efforts were not ultimately successful.'

Colin Mcinerney, 28, claims he was beaten and had his head stomped on by a man, two teenagers and a boy aged only about 10 on Friday night at the fast food restaurant in Coolalinga near Darwin. The man's 22-year-old girlfriend, Rachael Sheppard, told the NT News he had just gestured at the family by waving with his little pinky as people do in Darwin. Colin Mcinerney, 28, claims he was beaten and had his head stomped on by a man, two teenagers and a boy aged only about 10 on Friday night at the fast food restaurant in Coolalinga near Darwin . 'Then we arrived at Maccas and pulled up and the same car came through the drive through and the man got out and started yelling at us and asking what the hand gesture was all about and going right off his head,' Ms Sheppard said. Despite telling the family they thought they were someone different, the older man allegedly started bashing Mr Mcinerney. 'He even smashed a beer bottle over Col's head... it didn't look good,' Ms Sheppard said. 'I was yelling for him to stop and next thing you know three boys have jumped out of the back of their car and started bashing Col too.' Ms Sheppard said a woman behind the wheel of the car allegedly tried to ram her as Mr Mcinerney ran for cover at a nearby petrol station. '(They) caught up with Col and kept bashing and choking him,' she said. 'The younger boys were grabbing windscreen cleaners and water bottles and even had a windscreen wiper off their own car that they were using to attack Col with.'

NT Police Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen says officers were called to the McDonalds near Darwin about 7.15pm following reports of a 'violent disturbance' 'It was confirmed that two groups were travelling in their respective vehicles in the rural area when they pulled up beside each other at a set of traffic lights,' she said in a statement. 'One did a hand gesture to which another took offence. Both vehicles pulled over in McDonalds and a nasty altercation ensued.'

582,dd8e3f201190072935139bb97f0a3f34b807eeb6,"A Ukip MEP has praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a ‘very strong leader’ who has ‘put Russia first’. Diane James, Ukip’s Justice Spokesman, also applauded Mr Putin's nationalist credentials and argued he was forced into invading Ukraine because of the European Union. Ukip leader Nigel Farage sparked a row last year when he hailed Russian President as a ‘brilliant operator'. Scroll down for video . Praising Putin: Diane James, Ukip's Justice Spokesperson applauded Russian President Vladimir Putin's nationalist credentials . Taking part in a women leaders' debate on LBC radio, Mrs James - who is considered a potential successor of Nigel Farage - said: ‘Nigel went on record saying if you provoke the Russian bear you get a reaction. ‘I admire him from the point of view that he’s standing up for his country. He is very nationalist. ‘He is a very strong leader. He is putting Russia first, and he has issues with the way the EU encouraged a change of government in the Ukraine which he felt put at risk a Russian population in that country,' she said. Mrs James was the Ukip candidate in the Eastleigh by-election and currently represents the south east of England in the European Parliament. Ukip leader Nigel Farage caused controversy in March 2014 after he admitted he admired Putin as a ‘brilliant operator’ for his stance on the Syrian conflict. However, unlike Mrs James, he clarified his view on Putin by adding: ‘Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?’ His comments followed the annexation of Crimea, but before the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine and the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which is widely believed to have been carried out by Russian-supported separatists. Mrs James told presenter Iain Dale (far left) that she admires Putin because he stands up for his country . Ukip smiles: Diane James is widely considered to be Nigel Farage's successor as the leader of Ukip . Mrs James' comments came as Ukip’s election campaign chief admitted the party sometimes resembles a ‘rugby club on tour’ with members who can be ‘boorish’ and ‘chauvinistic’. Patrick O’Flynn, who is also the party’s economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to ‘work harder’ as it is ‘lagging’ behind with female voters. As he launched the party’s ‘policies for women’ alongside the Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans and Mrs James, Mr O’Flynn was forced to defend its ‘blokeish’ image under Nigel Farage. Mrs James' comments come as Ukip's campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn said the party resembled a 'rugby club on tour' He said: ‘Nigel has said sometimes Ukip has resembled a rugby club on tour. I think that's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that. ‘But we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party, men in the party, who should know better, have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism. When that happens I make sure I express my own displeasure. ‘We’re a very fast-growing party, we’re increasing our attraction – it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we’re not maximising our support in every potential group. ‘And, as set out today, there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters – we still are, we’ve got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing.’ The event was delayed after the Ukip-branded backdrop collapsed minutes before the press conference was due to begin, sparking frantic work to rebuild the set. The party used the event to confirm a raft of policies, including removing VAT from sanitary products, which they have dubbed a ‘tampon tax’. It also said it would give ‘absolute, full and unconditional’ support for current maternity and paternity leave laws, as well as making sure maternity wards are ‘properly resourced’. Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is ‘accepted cultural practice’ for some of ‘our ethnic compatriots’. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party’s election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on ‘lies’ and ‘myths’ spread about the party. She said: ‘I think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us. ‘There is this myth we will scrap maternity leave, that we hate women, that we don't do anything for women - I think Diane and I are living proof. ‘Unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep.’ Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom was forced out of the party in September 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as ‘sluts’. Mr Farage, who was absent from the women’s event, has previously been criticised for controversial remarks about breast-feeding and whether women are less valuable to employers after they have been on maternity leave. In a 2010 interview, the party leader who has often been photographed smoking cigarettes and drinking pints of beer, also boasted: ‘I’ve got so many women pregnant over the years.’","Diane James described her admiration for Putin during radio debate .

584,d65cb29b3a3484836928db5cfa40d1be009e11be,"A man who launched an online campaign to help him destroy his brand new $49,000 Jeep will read out a 'not sorry' apology to the company on national television tonight. In June last year,  Ashton Wood raised $18,000 online so he and 300 people could destroy his car after Jeep refused to pay a full refund for the car or replace the vehicle which he claimed had suffered 21 separate mechanical problems. During a failed settlement between the manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Jeep, and Mr Wood, one of the requests made by the car company was for the disgruntled buyer to publish an 'apology' in a national publication. However, because no one would publish the apology, he will instead read it out on the ABC's 'The Checkout' tonight. Scroll down for video . Ashton Wood issued this apology to Jeep after the car company requested he apologise for criticising them . The Queenslander launched a public campaign last year asking others to help him destroy his car in protest . Compiled by Mr Wood and the ABC's The Checkout, the apology reads: 'My personal apology to Jeep: I'm Sorry. 'Dear Jeep, I'm sorry. I'm sorry my Jeep broke down before it even left the dealership. 'I'm sorry it had 21 problems. I'm sorry it had to be towed four times. I'm sorry I wasn't more grateful for your offer of a new battery. 'I'm sorry you wouldn't offer me a replacement or refund. But most of all, I'm sorry I bought a Jeep.' Mr Wood launched a Kickstarter campaign last year in an effort to raise $22,500 - the amount Chrysler offered him to buyback the car - and allow donors the chance to be involved in the car's destruction. He is now campaigning for the United State's Lemon laws to be introduced in Australia. Pictured: 'lemon car' drivers protest against vehicle companies who refuse to refund or replace their cars . Mr Wood's extreme measures came after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010, had numerous problems . The extreme measures came after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010, had numerous problems including the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking. He claims years of campaigning the car manufacturer to refund or replace his car, which he bought from a Sunshine Coast dealer in Queensland had proved fruitless. Despite successfully destroying his vehicle, Mr Wood - who could not afford to challenge the international car company in court - has refused to back down. Along with a number of consumer led organsiations Mr Wood is campaigning for the United States' Lemon Laws to be introduced in Australia. These included the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking . He said that Lemon Laws state 'that if there's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked' 'Lemon is the old term which was used to mean a really bad car. In the U.S. they have had the Lemon Law's in place for about 35 years, we don't have it,' Mr Wood told Daily Mail Australia. 'They differ from state to state but in Kansas, where they have the most strict version, is states that if there's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked. 'It's a lot clearer than Australian consumer laws which just says that the product should be fit for purpose and the dealer should do the right thing. 'I'm not done yet. I want to keep the pressure up until the government sits up and takes some responsibility and reviews this law.' Consumer laws have somewhat improved since Mr Wood's story came to the public's attention, by including a notion of 'major failure'. However, they still remain unclear about a car owner's rights when their vehicle has a number of smaller problems like Mr Wood's. After Mr Wood's car was destroyed, a fire was lit to bring the rubble to nothing but scrap metal . Along with Lemon Laws for Australia and Lemon Vehicles in Australia, Mr Wood has launched several petitions and staged a number of events campaigning for more specific laws that address the holes in the legislation. They have sent out Lemon Law stickers to hundreds of Australians with 'lemon cars' in order to 'put pressure on the government and show that the movement is gaining momentum'. A spokesperson for Jeep told Daily Mail Australia 'we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat Mr Wood in a fair and professional manner'. Mr Woods car was destroyed over four hours with the help of 300 people who wielded bats and sledgehammers and shot bow and arrows at it at a demolition derby last year. More than 300 people turned out to either witness the public smashing or to take part in it . A spokesperson for Jeep told Daily Mail Australia 'we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat Mr Wood in a fair and professional manner' 'The car was spinning in the air with the auger through the top of the roof,' Mr Wood said. 'The whole car lifted two, maybe three foot off the ground before we crushed it and lit on fire.' He said the 'Pièce de résistance' was putting a flame to it and watching it burn before burying the scrap heap and laying flowers at the head of its makeshift burial plot. 'The serious side to it is that I shouldn't have had to destroy a $50,000 car,' he said. 'If the law was there today and if Chrysler group respected and looked after its customers then it wouldn't have had to happen.' Chrysler offered Mr Wood a settlement of $22,500 for the car, for which he originally paid $49,000. Despite knowing he could make $28,000 by selling it himself, he said felt uncomfortable with the option. Mr Wood's apology can be seen in full on Thursday night at 8pm on ABC's The Checkout.

Frankie Ruttledge, from Strensall, Yorkshire, weighed 18 stone 7lbs and had struggled with her weight all her life before dieting to a svelte size 10/12. The 24-year-old, who has been a 'fat bridesmaid' three times, ditched her diet of crisps for breakfast, pork pies for lunch and frozen pizza for dinner and dropped to 12 stone in less than two years. Frankie, pictured left at her Mum's wedding in 2010, always thought of herself as the 'fat bridesmaid' however she has now lost six stone and is looking forward to her own wedding . And now the Slimming World consultant is just one year away from walking down the aisle for a fourth time - to marry the love of her life Luke Haynes, 24. Frankie said: 'I have always been bigger - as a child I was always the biggest in my class. I just ate rubbish and had a really poor diet. I ate a lot of pasties and sausage rolls. 'I didn't think I'd ever be different. But then in September 2012 my sister asked me to be her bridesmaid and I promised her I would lose weight for her wedding. 'I wanted to look good for her wedding, but I just kept getting bigger and bigger - I couldn't shift the weight. Frankie poses with her fiance Luke Haynes, the pair are planning to marry next year and Frankie hopes to wear a size ten dress . 'It wasn't until that Christmas when my Aunty said to me she was shocked at how big I was, that it actually hit home. It was a bit of a rude awakening for me. I was mortified. 'When I lost the weight I actually sent her a card to say thank you. 'The bridesmaid dress they got for me was a size 28 - I was devastated. But in the end I fitted into a size 16 dress and I felt absolutely amazing that day.' Frankie was the Bridesmaid for many weddings over the years, by 2013 though (left) she had begun to lose weight and wore a size 16 dress for her sister's wedding . Frankie looks pleased as she holds up a pair of her own shorts. She has dropped from a size 22 to a size 10/12 . Frankie, who runs three Slimming World groups, was spurred on to turn her life around after a family member made a comment about how big she had gotten. And after her sister asked her to be a bridesmaid at her wedding - in May 2013 - Frankie gave it her all and watched as the pounds just seemed to drop off. Frankie joined a local Slimming World group and by changing her diet, and going to Zumba and aqua fit classes at the gym, she shed an amazing five stone in the first year. Breakfast: . Nothing. Crisps and dip as a snack later . Lunch: . A pasty or pork pie . Evening Meal: . Frozen pizza or a take away and pints of cider . Breakfast: . Yoghurt, oats and fruit . Lunch: . Stir fry or a Slimming World healthy fry up . Evening: . Homemade chilli or spaghetti bolognese . Frankie was not happy with her size and was spurred on to lose the weight by an aunt who commented that she was 'shocked' at how big she had become . Frankie and Luke lark about with a pair of her old trousers, Frankie was previously a size 22 . And it took her another 12 months to budge the final stone - tipping the scales at a much slimmer 12 stone five pounds before Christmas. Frankie said: 'The weight came off quickly and I just stuck to it. And the more weight I lost, the more I wanted to go to the gym as I didn't want to have any loose skin. 'And now I am just a much healthier person. I will go out for a run or take the dog for a long walk. I still want to lose a bit more but weight loss is an ongoing journey. I still have to work hard at it. 'And my next goal is my own wedding in the summer - I can't wait to walk down the aisle as a size 10 bride. 'My mum and future mother and sister-in-law are slimming too for it so we are all doing it together.

The decision to ban Hardy, who last played for the Carolina Panthers, followed a two-month NFL investigation that started after the dismissal of his domestic violence case in February. Hardy was informed in a letter by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that the probe determined there was 'sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects.' Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy has been suspended without pay for 10 games . Domestic violence charges against Hardy, who signed with Dallas last month, were abruptly dropped in February after his accuser could not be found to testify. The jury trial for Hardy had been set to begin in Charlotte after he was accused of assaulting his former girlfriend, Nicole Holder, and threatening to kill her. The league's probe, which involved numerous interviews with witnesses and experts, concluded that Hardy violated the NFL's personal conduct policy by using physical force against Holder in at least four instances. 'The net effect of these acts was that Ms. Holder was severely traumatized and sustained a range of injuries, including bruises and scratches on her neck, shoulders, upper chest, back, arms and feet,' Goodell wrote. 'The use of physical force under the circumstances present here, against a woman substantially smaller than you and in the presence of powerful, military-style assault weapons, constitutes a significant act of violence in violation of the Personal Conduct Policy.' Hardy arrives at Mecklenburg County jail on the first day of his domestic violence appeal trail . Hardy, a 2013 Pro Bowler who played only one game for the Panthers before being suspended last season, was accused of assaulting Holder last May, sending her to the hospital emergency room. The five-year NFL veteran was found guilty by a district court judge in July but appealed the verdict and was allowed to have a jury trial. Prosecutors said when Holder last spoke with them in November, she told them that she 'did not want to participate in another trial.' Holder had already reached a civil settlement with Hardy, prosecutors said. Hardy may appeal the NFL's decision within three days. 'You must have no further adverse involvement with law enforcement and must not commit any additional violations of league policies,' Goodell wrote. 'In that respect, you should understand that another violation of this nature may result in your banishment from the NFL.'

Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half. 'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack . Pjanic (second left) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe, and Daniele de Rossi after scoring . Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio, who play later on Saturday. They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth. Security was tight for Napoli's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game . Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points . Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order. But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post. A few minutes later, Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi, who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in.

Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there wasn't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli, who officiated last year's World Cup final. In the second half, De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions. The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th. Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net. Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November.","Roma win at home for the first time since November .

589,92b97b70b55eaf31be089e0420c76a1001e2451a,"A bruising training session involving 50 scrums is how Tom Wood’s Northampton prepared for Saturday’s top-of-the-table meeting with Saracens. The Champions have creaked in recent weeks and England flanker Wood, who claims Saints’ opponents have ‘smelt blood’, is desperate to re-gather the momentum that was lost following the exodus of key international players during the RBS 6 Nations. Defeats by Clermont and Exeter have done little to restore confidence but the East Midlands side are ready to address their mini-slump and breathe life back into the title push. Northampton flanker Tom Wood is keen for his side to regain their form following some recent poor results . The Saints were dumped out of the Champions Cup quarter-finals as Clermont ran riot on their home turf . ‘I don’t think anyone intentionally switches off, but the intensity of a Six Nations camp like that is very difficult to manage,’ said Wood. ‘Some people think you’re away at a five-star holiday resort but the pressure is real. It’s a couple of per cent across the board. ‘You might win it and be partying or you might have lost and come back with a lack of confidence. Then the guys who have stayed back in the trenches for Saints feel like the cavalry have arrived. In fact, the guys coming back are equally tired or even more so. It’s a combination of things and it’s difficult to manage. ‘Now there’s light at the end of the tunnel and we’re not far off full strength. It’s the home straight.’ Saturday’s showpiece fixture will be staged at stadiummk, rather than Franklin’s Gardens, and a record attendance is expected at the home of MK Dons. Northampton’s scrummaging pride was dented in the defeat by Exeter and, according to Wood, the players have paid the price with gruelling fitness sessions. ‘We’ve had to speak a few hard truths and take a good look at ourselves,’ said Wood. ‘Teams have smelt blood a little bit. The last couple of teams have really got into us and pressured us at the scrum, which is something we pride ourselves on. ‘When you give them an in, the fear factor goes all of a sudden and the reputation can dwindle quickly. We’ve got to plug that hole if we really want to be title challengers. You don’t win a Premiership without a strong scrum and set piece. Jim Mallinder's side have been boosted by the return of England lock Courtney Lawes . ‘We’ve definitely been knocked off our rhythm but I don’t think we’ve played well for a long time. Winning can paper over a lot of problems and mask a lot of issues.’ But Saints’ season is still very much alive. They will almost guarantee a home play-off with victory while, in contrast, Harlequins campaign will be over if they lose to Sale. The west London club also felt the squeeze of the Six Nations and they must win at the AJ Bell Stadium to keep alive their slim hopes of Champions Cup qualification. Harlequins full back Ugo Monye (centre) is hanging up his boots at the end of the season . For winger Ugo Monye, who lines up against Mark Cueto this afternoon as both players prepare to hang up their boots, it is the last chance to leave his childhood club with European rugby. ‘I’m not going to be here next season but I want to finish in the best possible way,’ said Monye. ‘It’s hard to get your head around 14 years coming to an end, because I’ve been here since I finished school and it’s all I’ve known. I might be locking horns with Mark Cueto, who’s also retiring, this weekend and it will be just as competitive as the first time I faced him.’ GLOUCESTER v NEWCASTLE (SATURDAY: Kingsholm, 3pm) Dan Robson and Billy Burns form a new half-back pairing for the hosts, in a reshuffled side led by Billy Twelvetrees.

590,8fb1adb92d6490e5b859a21b4781329317e301c0,"A catalogue of failings have been uncovered at two NHS hospitals after seven babies and three mothers died there in the space of just eight months. Independent investigators were called into Royal Oldham after the deaths of four babies and two mothers, and North Manchester General after the deaths of another three babies and one mother. Lisa Parkisson, 35, died at Oldham Royal 48 hours after giving birth in April this year, while newborn Thomas Beaty died at the same hospital in June after doctors pushed him back into the womb during birth. Lisa Parkisson, 35, (left with son Zac) died 48 hours after giving birth at Oldham Royal in June last year. Thomas Beaty (right) died from  at the same hospital after doctors forced him back into the womb . A summary of the investigation, which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now, has been seen by MailOnline and found 'notable absence of clinical leadership' in the maternity wards, and a 'failure to adequately plan care' in a number of cases. A team of independent investigators also found risk management was 'below standard' in some cases - though there were no apparent 'deficiencies in care' in the deaths of the three mothers. The report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese, which can lead to complications, but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed. Officials also criticised the hospital's own investigations, saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified, opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up, and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure. All of the deaths are believed to have occurred between December 2013, and July last year. In one case mother Lisa Parkisson, 35, also died 48 hours after giving birth to her son Zac in June this year. In another case newborn Thomas Beaty died from head injuries in April after medics forced him back into the womb during birth. Doctors had also tried and failed to remove him from the womb five times using forceps, despite national guidelines only recommending three attempts. While his death was not included in the review, staff at North Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which controls the two hospitals, have asked investigators to look into it. Martin Beaty, the father of Thomas, said: 'Ten deaths in eight months is sickening. But I'm not surprised. Independent investigators found failings in care and hospital leadership at Oldham Royal following the deaths of four babies and two mothers there in eight months . The report, which also looked into the deaths of three babies and another mother at North Manchester General, found that national guidelines for treating obese mothers were also not followed . 'The standard of care we received during and after Thomas died gives me zero confidence in their organisation, structure and accountability. 'I'm angry we were not informed [about the report], even if out of courtesy. It feels like they're trying to cover each other's backs. 'But I'm fully behind any action that makes sure this sort of thing is prevented in the future.' Pennine Acute is in the process of producing an action plan based on the recommendations from the findings. They include strengthening clinical leadership and risk management, making sure enough staff are on duty to ensure safety and reviewing the process for employing temporary locum doctors. Royal Oldham Hospital's new maternity unit, children's unit and neonatal intensive care unit opened in December 2012. The £44m facility became one of three specialist Greater Manchester neonatal centres as part of a controversial £120m shake-up which saw maternity units shut in Bury, Rochdale and Salford. Gill Harris, Chief Nurse at Pennine Acute, said: 'The Trust is always keen to learn and to improve care. We commissioned a review by experts from outside the Trust to look at the details of a small number of maternity cases at our hospitals. 'We are now considering that report and are developing a number of actions as a result to make some improvements to ensure we continue to provide the best quality of care for our patients. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' A spokeswoman for the Care Quality Commission, the health regulator, said: 'CQC is aware that Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has recently initiated an external review into its maternity services and we are in close liaison with the trust, NHS England and local CCG regarding the review findings.'","Four babies and two mothers died in Oldham Royal hospital maternity unit .

Carter and Jack Hanson, who live in Raleigh, North Carolina, met their hero on the Yorktown - a retired carrier in Charleston, where Mr Harding served as an aircraft handler decades before, CBS reported. It was an emotional first meeting for the three friends who had been in contact for about a year via email after the twins learned about Mr Harding on their first trip to Yorktown and the Patriot's Point museum.

The friends sent each other emails every day but only got to meet on board the Yorktown recently. They spent the day exploring the ship together with the boys hearing first-hand just what life was like on board a real battleship. The boys told CBS in an interview that meeting Mr Harding, who lives in Oklahoma, has changed their lives. Carter said: 'We want to know what his voice actually sounds like. We want to touch him. We want to know him a lot more.' The ten-year-old added: 'I just realized how amazing history can be.' And getting first-person history lessons hasn't only been good for the twins, it appeared Mr Harding had been looking for someone to share his stories with. The veteran told CBS: 'I guess I needed somebody to talk to about it. It's surprising the way it worked out.'

592,787016c8e76b8e3fbf63d5e7356d86e4a0e2bc9c,"A former elementary school teacher who police say was obsessed with one of her 11-year-old students has waived a preliminary hearing on a felony charge that she interfered with the girl's legal custody. Geraldine Alcorn, 29, of Pittsburgh, and her attorney declined to comment as they walked from a city magistrate's courtroom Wednesday. In exchange for the waiver — which means Alcorn must now stand trial on the charge or take some kind of plea bargain — Allegheny County prosecutors dropped two other misdemeanors she faced: luring a child into a vehicle and corruption of minors. Leaving court: Geraldine Alcorn, left, leaves court on Wednesday April 1, 2015, in Pittsburgh after waiving a preliminary hearing on  Wednesday on a felony charge that she interfered with the girl's custody .

Obsessed teacher: Geraldine Alcorn, 28, faces multiple charges for 'obsessively' texting an 11-year-old student . Prosecutors, who also declined to comment, allege Alcorn encrypted her phone number on the girl's math homework, exchanged thousands of text messages with her and even talked of adopting and running away with the girl before Alcorn resigned last month. The girl's mother, a single parent, complained to school officials after finding out Alcorn had visited the girl at their home while the mother was working. The mother then found stickers and letters from Alcorn in the girl's school binder, plus two letters the girl wrote to Alcorn with three headings: 'Things Ms. Alcorn and I can do,' ''what we can do,' and 'when we can do it,' the criminal complaint said. The girl told police she and Alcorn kept their relationship secret and, among other things, Alcorn discussed adopting the girl or taking her from her home. Alcorn had told the girl that 'they would be on the run for a while,' if Alcorn followed through on that, police said. Alcorn is not believed to have sexual feelings for the girl but allegedly told police of a 'deep love' she has for her. Pittsburgh Public Schools officials learned Feb. 13 that 'a teacher had developed an improper attachment' with a student at Pittsburgh Beechwood, a pre-K-5 school. Alcorn resigned March 2. Police said she tried to contact the girl on March 13, a Friday, when Alcorn returned to gather her personal belongings. The following Monday, police said, the girl found 'gifts and several letters, some encrypted, in her locker and desk,' according to the criminal complaint. 'The letters, written by Alcorn, instructed the 11-year-old female to contact her.' Alcorn hid her phone number on a math worksheet by telling the girl to dial numbers that had been circled, police said.

Laser expert Patrick Priebe  created a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm. And in a video, the contraption is shown popping balloons and lighting matches from feet away. Scroll down for video . Laser expert Patrick Priebe  built a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm (pictured lighting a match) The gadget was created by Wuppertal-based Mr Priebe, who designs and builds metal laser gadgets to order online. He posts videos to YouTube as AnselmoFanZero. His Laser Gloves and Laser Gauntlet/Arm are  available to order in varying wavelengths. Earlier this year, Mr Priebe built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. The inventor said, although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside . A video shows the rapid-fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall. Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. These range from the blue 405nm-type laser model to one fitted with 445nm, or 650nm. He also offers a 'low power green' version on his website. The gadgets are powered by Lithium-ion cells and output ranges between 0.2W and 1.2W. Prices are not known. The Laser Glove can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and can be made for either the left or right hand, or both. He has previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and  a built-in laser pointer. The rechargeable watch has an LED watch module and 1,500-milliwatt laser. Earlier this year, the same German inventor built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. The inventor said that although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside. A video shows the rapid-fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall.

The glove was inspired by Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jnr (pictured) Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. The inventor is obviously fearful his designs will fall into the wrong hands, too, as he states on his website: 'No plans, no schematics, no blueprints'. The laser weapon is a taken on the iconic Gatling gun invented by Richard Gatling in the 1860s. Mr Priebe  previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and built-in laser pointer (shown) Mr Priebe admitted  the watch was a ‘pain in the a’ to make because of all the tiny parts, and the total watch took him around 40 hours to complete. The watch is pictured popping balloons on a wall . The laser watch was inspired by 1964 Bond film Goldfinger. In this scene, Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Fröbe) ties James Bond (Sean Connery) to a table and threatens to cut him using the laser pointer (pictured) In a video for Reactions, the American Chemical Society took a look at the science of Marvel's Avengers. Tony Stark's original suit, made only of iron, would have weighed around 70kg (150lbs) according to the ACS - not very comfortable or easy to move around in. He later upgrades it to a gold-titanium alloy, but that would actually make things worse explained the video. ‘That suit would probably weigh around 160kg (350lbs), which might work for the Hulk but not for Tony Stark,’ said the narrator. However, Dr Raychelle Burks continued that it is later made of a nickel-titanium alloy called nitinol. The American Chemical Society in Washington recently explained the science behind the Avengers in a video. It looked at the composition of Iron Man's suit - said to be a gold-titanium alloy in one of the movies - and Captain America's shield. The video also explained the science behind super-healing abilities . This is ‘strong but light, and can be reformed after taking damage,’ she said. ‘There may also be some graphite reinforced with carbon fibre, which can take a lot of heat - useful if Iron Man doesn’t want to singe his feet using those rocket boots.’ None of this would work, though, without Stark’s own portable nuclear power station - the Arc Reactor. In Iron Man 2 this uses palladium - but we soon learn this is poisoning and killing the character. So instead, he creates a new element - and Dr Burks said this might not be as far-fetched as it seems. He uses his own particle accelerator to smash the nuclei of atoms together and make a new type of atom, which is not entirely dissimilar to the experiments taking place at real-life accelerators such as Cern.","Iron Man-style arm and hand was built by laser expert Patrick Priebe .

Mark O'Meara celebrates his winning putt in 1998 . 20 Mark O'Meara, 1998 . Aged 41, Mark O'Meara's chances of a major championship appeared to have gone despite a fine career and many victories on the PGA Tour. But O'Meara shot two birdies in three holes from the 15th on Sunday and a good approach into the 18th left him with a 20-footer to beat David Duval and Fred Couples. In the manner of his great friend Tiger Woods, he drained it. And he was soon handed his green jacket by Woods in the Butler Cabin. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . 19 Billy Joe Patton, 1954 . Billy Joe Patton came within a stroke of perhaps the biggest Masters shock of all but narrowly missed out on a play-off with Sam Snead and Ben Hogan. But for a short while it had appeared that an amateur golfer could topple two of the greatest ever to play the game, thanks to his hole-in-one on the par-three sixth on Sunday. Sadly, Patton's hopes were ultimately shot down by a double bogey on the 13th attempting to fly Rae's Creek and reach the green in two. Otherwise his ace would have featured near the very top of this list. Billy Joe Patton hits on the 13th hole... the scene of the double-bogey which ultimately cost him victory . CLICK HERE for the second part of our countdown, featuring videos of shots from the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods... 18 Seve Ballesteros, 1983 . Seve's second Masters victory featured what he called 'the best golf of my life' over the first four holes, and one 205-yard 2-iron on the fourth was utterly spectacular. But nothing quite sums up the genius of the late, great Spaniard than the way he clinched his four-shot victory over Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw. An up and down for a bogey would have comfortably sewn up his victory, but showman Seve was having none of it and chipped in for a par four. 17 Byron Nelson, 1937 . Byron Nelson found himself a somewhat daunting six shots behind Ralph Guldahl in the final round of the 1937 tournament. But his comeback was complete on the par-five 13th after he found the cup with a chip for eagle from off the green, while his rival could only manage bogey. Lord Byron came from four strokes down to two ahead in just 25 minutes, and went on to win the first of his five majors by that same margin. Byron Nelson and club member Alfred Bourne at the presentation ceremony in 1937 . 16 Vijay Singh, 2009 . OK, so this isn't actually during the Masters itself, but have you ever seen anything like it? The big Fijian won the green jacket in 2000 but may not have hit a finer shot than this one during the annual par-three tournament on the Wednesday before the 2009 edition. Vijay skimmed his ball across a lake and watched as it rolled onto the green and into the cup for an ace. You'll need to see it to believe it. 15 Nick Faldo, 1989 . With dark descending, in dank drizzle and with wind whipping the course, Nick Faldo became only the second Briton ever to win the Masters after a play-off with Scott Hoch. His nerveless approach over the water on the 11th hole was good, but the putt was even better. Faldo recalled how his caddie, Andy Prodger, told him it was too dark to see the line of the shot, but he stroked it pure and right into the heart of the cup. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE SHOT . Nick Faldo celebrates his brilliant putt to win the Masters in a play-off in 1989 . 14 Charl Schwartzel, 2011 . Charl Schwartzel's victory three years ago is most famous for his rip-roaring finish - four birdies in the final four holes sealed his first major title - but his start was no less incredible. After missing the first green, the South African somehow chipped in from 100 feet for a remarkable birdie. And then, on the third, he slam-dunked his approach from the fairway for an eagle two. Two incredible shots, but the gods truly were smiling on Schwartzel that day. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . Charl Schwartzel (right) is presented with his green jacket by Phil Mickelson in 2011 . 13 Phil Mickelson, 2004 . Phil Mickelson had long carried the burden of being known as 'the best player never to have won a major' - just ask Lee Westwood how wearisome that feels. Lefty had a string of near-misses behind him - six second and third places - when he went toe-to-toe with Ernie Els over the back nine at Augusta that Sunday. And it all came down to the final green as Phil the Thrill sank an 18-footer for birdie under huge pressure to cast off that unwanted reputation once and for all. 12 Fuzzy Zoeller, 1979 . Imagine playing in your very first Masters... and standing over a putt to win, in a sudden-death play-off. It was the first time the Masters had been decided in such a way, was played in the gathering gloom and also included Ed Sneed and the great Tom Watson. In near darkness, Zoeller held his nerve to sink his birdie putt on the 11th hole and make history. 11 Louis Oosthuizen, 2012 . Some might argue that this is the best shot in Masters history - but some would also say it wasn't even the best shot of the day (see the countdown from 10-1). Whatever, it's hard to think of a more perfectly envisioned, controlled and executed long iron in the history of the game. Oosthuizen catapulted himself into the lead (and an eventual play-off) with this 253-yard approach into the par-five second hole that pitched on a sixpence at the front of the green. From then on, it was never going anywhere other than the centre of the cup.

The German World Cup winner is currently on loan at Inter Milan having joined the Serie A club in January following a tough start to the season at the Emirates, where he scored just three goals in 13 appearances. The move to Italy appeared to signal the end of Podolski’s time in north London, but the 29-year-old is adamant he still has a role to play in Arsene Wenger’s side. Inter Milan loanee Lukas Podolski says he wants to play for parent club Arsenal next season . The German forward has yet to score since arriving in Serie A in January . ‘When I go back (to Arsenal) I think I have the chance to play there,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I have one year left so well will see what happens. I feel very well at the club and with my teammates as well.

Podolski struggled for first-team opportunities in north London before leaving the Gunners on loan . Podolski has failed to score in 12 appearances since arriving in Italy, but he says there is no frustration over the lack of time he’s getting on the pitch. ‘It’s not a problem for me. I’ve been in this business of playing football long enough,’ he said. ‘Of course I want to play every game but it’s the decision of the coach, he makes the decision and picks the first XI and when he thinks the players on the pitch are better than me or in better form than me then they have to play. ‘I’m ready, I’m fit, I want to play because a derby is always a great game and it’s for these types of matches you play football. ‘I’m here now to finish the season then I have two games with the national team, then we will see.’ Podolski celebrates with Alexis Sanchez after scoring the winner against Anderlecht in October .","Lukas Podolski left Arsenal for Inter Milan on a loan deal in January .

The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting ""We are not afraid. We stand together,""  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. ""You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' "" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a ""cowardly act."" ""To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,"" Larry Moneta said Wednesday. Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Student is no longer on Duke University campus and will face disciplinary review .

Researchers studying chimps in Uganda say the apes are having to adapt to cope with increasingly busy roads cutting across their territory. They found at a busy asphalted road through the Sebitoli area of Kibale National Park in Uganda, the chimps have learned to look both ways before crossing. Chimpanzees crossing a busy road in Kibale National Park in Uganda (above) have learned to look for traffic . Scientists discovered the chimps will also often run across roads, while dominant males will wait to ensure younger chimps cross safely. It is the first time chimpanzees have been seen to change their behaviour to adapt to busy roads. Chimpanzees appear to flavour their food with herbs, researchers have suggested. Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and her colleagues have found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught. They reason that if this was for medicinal purposes, different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments. However, the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat, suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead. Dr Krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at Budongo Forest Reserve and Kibale National Park ate plants while chewing meat. Marie Cibot, a biologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, who led the work, said the spread of road infrastructure in Africa was posing a growing threat to wildlife in many countries. She said: 'Although the asphalted road represents a substantial threat to crossing animals, chimpanzees took into account this risk. 'More than 90 per cent of the individuals looked right and left before and while crossing. 'Chimpanzees crossed in small subgroups. Whole parties crossed more rapidly when chimpanzees were more numerous in the crossing groups.' The researchers say the road in Sebitoli sees around 89 motor vehicles an hour racing down it at speeds of between 40mph and 60mph. The researchers said they saw several different primates killed on the roads in the past year. However, chimpanzees living in the surrounding forests appear to have learned about the danger it poses. They watched 122 chimps cross the road over the course of two and half years. They found most of the chimps looked for traffic before crossing and as they crossed. Adult chimps, like this one, tended to wait for younger chimps to cross and checked they got over safely . Females with young and injured adults tended to cross less frequently. Around 20 per cent of the chimps that crossed would turn to check on other members of the group to ensure they were crossing safely. They also tended to form small groups of between two to three chimpanzees that crossed at a time. Chimps have been noticed to cross in similar ways on other non-asphalted roads. However, on quieter roads, adults tend to lead the group in a similar way as they do when checking for predators rather than splitting up into smaller groups. The researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, have appealed for measures to help reduce the impact roads were having on wildlife. Miss Cibot, who worked on the study with Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and the Great Ape Conservation Project in Uganda, said bridges or underpasses could be provided to help keep chimps safe. The team are hoping to work with the Ugandan authorities to test new safety measures. Miss Cibot said: 'These observations are relevant for our understanding of adaptive behavior among chimpanzees in human-impacted habitats. 'Further investigations are needed to better evaluate the effects of busy roads on adolescent female dispersal and on their use of territories. 'Mitigation measures, like bridges, underpasses, reduced speed limits, speed-bumps, signposts, or police controls, should be established in this area.'","Chimps were observed crossing busy road in Kibale National Park, Uganda .

599,00217448b38d81a23db66ac362bee25056f58fab,"Her neighbour’s leylandii hedge stands 40ft tall and, says Audrey Alexander, has left parts of her garden in deep shade. What’s more, it now seems likely to remain that way. Despite a 35-year fight to get the trees cut down to size, the council has ruled they can stay. It is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of Mrs Alexander’s family. It kicked off 35 years ago when Mrs Alexander’s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii. A row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge (pictured) has finally come to and end after 35 years . The battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour's massive hedge . Then, 23 years ago, single mother Mrs Alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour Jeanette Robinson to trim the hedge. She claims Mrs Robinson refused and declared: ‘I would rather move than touch these trees.’ The dispute rumbled on, with Mrs Alexander, 54, claiming that the trees knocked £20,000 off the value of her property. She sensed an opportunity, however, with the passing of the High Hedge Act in Scotland in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases. Stirling Council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay, despite claims it has knocked £20,000 off the value of neighbour Audrey Alexander's house (pictured) The situation came to a head in 2008, when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour's garden shed . Audrey Alexander (pictured) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches . But her council has ruled that Mrs Robinson can keep the hedge, although it has to be cut to 20ft. Mrs Alexander said the ruling made ‘no difference’. The High Hedge Act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden. Complainants and the hedge's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort. Because the effect the hedge has is not always clear, disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached. The local authority can either issue a high hedge notice, which orders owners to cut the hedge back, or decide not to act. The local authority cannot make any orders about the roots of the hedge. She added: ‘The whole situation is appalling – the legislation is about giving people the right to sunlight. ‘It’s a disgrace and I feel extremely let down.’ The neighbour refused to comment. Mrs Alexander’s only option is the courts which she cannot afford to do. Over the years she had used the mediation services of Stirling District Council to try to resolve the issue. The situation came to a head in 2008, when she claims a 65ft section of hedge fell, demolishing a neighbour’s garden shed. Following the introduction of the High Hedge Act, Stirling Council found in her favour but the neighbour appealed and won the 20ft ruling. Dr Colin Watson, of Scothedge, a group which demands the end of ‘high hedge tyranny’, said that the council’s decision was ‘pretty crazy’. A council spokesman said the decision was made ‘after carrying out a site inspection and considering all the evidence’. Mrs Alexander said her aunt, now 87, had moved to France to enjoy ‘sunshine and gardening’. Ms Alexander called in Stirling District Council to try to solve the quarrel, but no solution could be found and the feud continued . The council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft, a height which Ms Alexander claims will still block most of her sunlight .","Audrey Alexander wanted her neighbours to chop down their huge hedge .
